Typescript is a superset of Javascript - all valid JS will work as TS
TS enhances coding experience by enabling you to write code with greater confidence in the stability and longevity of projects, Makes your code less error prone

Lesson 1: Introduction = 0:30 =========================================================================================================================================================================================================
Checks code during compile time - in real time with a linter - dramatically reduces the amount of app crashing run time errors that can occur -TS catches alot of errors before they even pop up/pushed live
Adds productivity - Takes slightly more time to write than regular JS, but TS has autocomplete/refactoring capabilities, immediate error checking, improves DX and more
Improves Employability - Learning TS is considered "Table Steaks" - even as a junior/mid level developer, you should know TS - will set you aparat from other juniors
The Course Covers:
  Basic, Literal, and Custom types / Optional Properties / Unions / Type Narrowing / Utility Types(built in types) / Generics(custom utility types)  
It is discouraging to see the wall of red errors pop up when you convert a '.js' into a '.tsx' : 'Typescript is not making your life terrible. It's showing you how terrible your life already is.' (vs living(surviving) in canada)
TS doesn't solve every programming problem - It's main purpose is fixing possible runtime errors / type errors - Not every error in your code is a runtime type error - Won't protect against logical errors

Lesson 2: Intro To Pizza App = 6:45 ====================================================================================================================================================================================================
Pizza Restaurant Menu - Will have an array of items, each of those items will have a name 

Lesson 3: Move code to TS = 16:55 ======================================================================================================================================================================================================
simply change the extension from '.js' to '.ts' - greeted with a wall of red text, 5 errors
every time you see the red squigglie lines, just hover the mouse over to see the problem/intellisense - sometimes recomendations for fixes
when you use Typescript, you aren't introducing new bugs, it's just showing you where they currently are - they already existed

Lesson 4: Defensive Coding = 20:00 =====================================================================================================================================================================================================
Assume that code pushed to production will take the 'sad path' - it assumes that problems will occur, edge cases will happen, and address the problems in the code from the start instead of in production = Defensive Coding
if one of our variables is undefined we can use an if else statement : if selectedPizza exists run the code, else it doesn't - return null
'completeOrder("1")' #typescript could not detect this bug in the code, it should be just a number

Lesson 5: Obligatory types basics lesson = 24:35 ========================================================================================================================================================================================
