GraphQL = Query Language for your API, with a server-side run time for executing queries, using a type system you define for your data, GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine
GraphQL creates a uniform API across your entire application without being limited by a specific storage engine. Write GraphQL APIs that leverage your existing data and code with GraphQL engines available in many languages.
{
  me {
    name
  }
} 
#above how a basic query looks, will return below
{
  "me": {
    "name" : "Sean"
  }
}

#GraphQL Query:
{
  hero {
    name
    friends {
      name
      homeWorld {
        name
        climate
      }
      species {
        name
        lifespan
        origin {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
#GraphQL Schema for above query:
type Query {
  hero: Character
}
 
type Character {
  name: String
  friends: [Character]
  homeWorld: Planet
  species: Species
}
 
type Planet {
  name: String
  climate: String
}
 
type Species {
