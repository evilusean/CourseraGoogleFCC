GraphQL = Query Language for your API, with a server-side run time for executing queries, using a type system you define for your data, GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine
GraphQL creates a uniform API across your entire application without being limited by a specific storage engine. Write GraphQL APIs that leverage your existing data and code with GraphQL engines available in many languages.
{
  me {
    name
  }
} #how a basic query looks, will return below
{
  "me": {
    "name" : "Sean"
  }
}
