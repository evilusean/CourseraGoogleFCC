The 'package.json' file is the center of any Node.js project or npm package. It stores information about your project.
  It consists of a single JSON object where information is stored in key-value pairs. 
  There are only two required fields; 'name' and 'version', but itâ€™s good practice to provide additional information.
'npm init' #You can create the package.json file from the terminal using the npm init command.
  This will run a guided setup. Using npm init with the -y flag will generate the file without having it ask any questions, npm init -y
If you look at the file tree of your project, you will find the package.json file on the top level of the tree.
  This is the file that you will be improving in the next couple of challenges.
One of the most common pieces of information in this file is the 'author' field. 
  It specifies who created the project, and can consist of a string or an object with contact or other details. 
  An object is recommended for bigger projects, but a simple string like the following example will do for this project.
