'dotnet new console -n <My New Project>' #used to create a new C# project
'dotnet build' #will build current app
'dotnet run' #will run app
C# is case sensitive
namespace HelloWorld {class Program {Static void Main(string[] args){console.WriteLine("Hello World!"}} } #same as in Java, except 'string' isn't capitlized 'Main' must be capitalized, required for .NET
using System; # declare dependancies with 'using' keyword 'using System' unused dependancies will be greyed out
System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); #if you delete the 'using System' at the top, you can still call it by adding a 'System.', you don't have to define that you are using 'System' can just be used
'Console.ReadLine();' #will wait for an input from the user, if put before the end of a function, will wait till enter is pressed before closing

Numeric Data Types = 11:00 ===================================================================================================================================================================================
int age = 23; #integer, 'initializing and declaring in the same line' or just initialize first then declare later like 'int age;' 'age = 23' initialize = first time, assignment = second+ time when you give a value
Console.WriteLine(age); #prints variable 'age' to console, nothing groundbreaking here
long bigNumber = 1234567890123456789L; #saves as int 32(4 bytes), notice the capital 'L' at the end, this tells the compiler to read it as a long number (int 64 = 8 bytes), same as Java
float negative = -123.456F; #float: Single-precision floating-point. It typically has 7 decimal digits of precision., notice the 'F' at end of number, this declares it as a float for compiler Size: 4 bytes (32 bits)
double negative = -123.456; #double: Double-precision floating-point. It typically has 15-16 decimal digits of precision. Size: 8 bytes (64 bits)
decimal money = 3.50M; //decimal Precision: 28-29 significant digits Size: 16 bytes (128 bits), Notice the 'M' at the end, this makes it explicit for the compiler
int x, y, z; #will allow you to declare multiple variable integers at once instead of each taking up a line, you can declare them the same way as well 'int x=10, y=20, z=30;' will work
