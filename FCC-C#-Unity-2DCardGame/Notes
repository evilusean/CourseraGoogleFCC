Preamble :
It's an old tutorial, about 4 years old, everything should still work in theory, I just learned C# and now need to learn how to use this, I want a 2D game that can be played in a browser on PC/mobile

'Game Object Menu' (top dropdown) -> 'UI' -> 'Canvas' #he creates a canvas, it just adds a small circle to the scene, and adds it to the left hand side 'Hierarchy' menu which can be viewed in the inspector
'Right Click' + Drag = Move Around Canvas
'Mouse Wheel Up/Down' = Scroll In/Out
'Play' (top middle below dropdowns) = Will automatically take you to the game tab
