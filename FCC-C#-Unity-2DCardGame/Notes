Preamble :
It's an old tutorial, about 4 years old, everything should still work in theory, I just learned C# and now need to learn how to use this, I want a 2D game that can be played in a browser on PC/mobile
I need to learn basically everything, I didn't even know how to add anything when I first opened up unity, brand new, hopefully this will teach me enough that I can build from there
just found out that Unity is owned by '"them"'(they have an infinite money glitch) still going to make my 2D game in it, but going to jump ship pretty quickly afterthat just so I can put C#/Unity on my resume

1 - How to Create a 2D Card Game in Unity - Part 1 (Setup and Basic Game Architecture) : =======================================================================================================================

There are 2 views 'scene' and 'game' - he immediately switches to 'scene'
'Game Object Menu' (top dropdown) -> 'UI' -> 'Canvas' #he creates a canvas, it just adds a small circle to the scene, and adds it to the left hand side 'Hierarchy' menu which can be viewed in the inspector
'Right Click' + Drag = Move Around Canvas
'Mouse Wheel Up/Down' = Scroll In/Out
'Play' (top middle below dropdowns) = Will automatically take you to the game tab -
the UI is hilariously similar to a Reaper DAW - moreso than blender and gimp - where instead of audio files it has game assets, objects instead of tracks
- First create the background that looks like a table top = 
  'Game Object Menu' (top dropdown) -> 'UI' -> 'Image' #will create an image, and automatically nests it as a child of our newly created canvas in the hierarchy
  'Right Click' in the hierarchy the new image to rename it to 'Background'
  'Inspector' (right hand side) -> 'Color' will give you pallette
For some reason when I clicked 'Play' the background was staying the default dark blue, I had a workaround for this by going to 'Main Camera' in hierarchy and changing the background to black there instead
I think I figured out why this broke yesterday, the default square I was using for the size of the original image was so small it was like a pixel, just swapped view from 'game' to 'simulator'(ipad?)

Creating Player and Opponent Areas : 
After setting the background, you now want to create 2 areas one for yourself -
I messed up somewhere, the space I'm working in is wayyyy too small, It's like 1 pixel in size - fixed,
'Project Tab' = Essentially a filesystem to organize as you see fit 
  'PreFabs' = Create a new folder in the 'Assets' folder - Drag the newly created 'Background' 'PlayerArea' 'EnemyArea' here
    This will create a prefab of each of those areas that you can use to populate instances of that object in the game as you need, creating a cookie cutter instead making each cookie everytime
