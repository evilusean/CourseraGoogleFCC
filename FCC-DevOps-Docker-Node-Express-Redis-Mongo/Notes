Start : 16October2024

Tut will have us set up a NodeJS and Express App inside a docker container with a MongoDB and Redis
npm init -y #will create a 'package.json' in your cwd
npm install express #will install express, add it to 'package.json' 'package-lock.json'
create a 'index.js'
const express = require("express"); #imports express
const app = express();
app.get("/", (req, res) => {res.send("<h1>Test Success</h2>");}); #quick route for testing purposes, "/" from route path, will send back the response as an h2 element 'Test Success'
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000; #will set the port to the environment variable, or default to 3000
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`listening on port${port}`)); #when appconnects to a port will print out which port it is on
#above is the simplest express app you can build
'node index.js' #in the terminal, will run the above script on 'localhost:3000'

Docker: 
Install Docker on Arch Linux: 
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux/archlinux/
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Docker
-Couldn't install docker-desktop, did a 'sudo pacman -Syu' and going to reboot, system update and reboot worked, now have docker desktop installed on Arch linux(btw.)
https://hub.docker.com/ #where images are saved
https://hub.docker.com/_/node #official node docker image, a lightweight img with node already installed, you can select which version you want
The image above doesn't have everything we want, the idea(l) of an image is that it has everything in it for your application to work, so you will need:
Source code(Application)/Dependancies/etc
So we are going to create our own custom image based on that node image, I need to fix my '.gitignore' file so I'm not uploading the docker image to github
