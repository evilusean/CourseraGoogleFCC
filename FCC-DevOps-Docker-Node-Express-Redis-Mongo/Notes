Start : 16October2024

Tut will have us set up a NodeJS and Express App inside a docker container with a MongoDB and Redis
npm init -y #will create a 'package.json' in your cwd
npm install express #will install express, add it to 'package.json' 'package-lock.json'
create a 'index.js'
const express = require("express"); #imports express
const app = express();
app.get("/", (req, res) => {res.send("<h1>Test Success</h2>");}); #quick route for testing purposes, "/" from route path, will send back the response as an h2 element 'Test Success'
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000; #will set the port to the environment variable, or default to 3000
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`listening on port${port}`)); #when appconnects to a port will print out which port it is on
#above is the simplest express app you can build
'node index.js' #in the terminal, will run the above script on 'localhost:3000'

Docker: 
Install Docker on Arch Linux: 
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux/archlinux/
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Docker
-Couldn't install docker-desktop, did a 'sudo pacman -Syu' and going to reboot, system update and reboot worked, now have docker desktop installed on Arch linux(btw.)
https://hub.docker.com/ #where images are saved
https://hub.docker.com/_/node #official node docker image, a lightweight img with node already installed, you can select which version you want
The image above doesn't have everything we want, the idea(l) of an image is that it has everything in it for your application to work, so you will need:
Source code(Application)/Dependancies/etc
So we are going to create our own custom image based on that node image, I need to fix my '.gitignore' file so I'm not uploading the docker image to github
Take that node image, copy our source code into that node image, then install all dependancies, then build that final image that has everything we need to run the app
To create a custom image, you need to create a 'Dockerfile' which is just a set of instructions that docker is going to run to create a custom image
  It will run a set of commands the create the docker image :
The first command you will always have to do is specify a base image, it can be a known image you own, or hub.docker.com image, anywhere
'FROM node:15' #will take the 'node' image from docker hub the ':15' specifies the version number (15 here) default is ':latest'
'WORKDIR /app' #notice how all commands are in caps, this will set the working directory to be the '/app' directory within the container
  After setting the work directory, any time you run a command, it's going to run that command from that directory, so put all the application code in /app, then run 'index.js' on '/app' and it will run
