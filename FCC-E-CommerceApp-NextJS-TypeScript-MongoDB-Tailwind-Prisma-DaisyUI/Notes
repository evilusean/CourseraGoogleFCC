tailwind css

npx create-next-app@latest
typescript: yes / eslint: yes / ESLint: yes / TailwindCSS: yes / src/directory: yes / AppRouter: yes / import alias: no
'npm run dev' to test if setup was successful localhost:3000

Installing prerequisite packages:
npm i daisyui prisma @prisma/client next-auth @auth/prisma-adapter prettier eslint-config-prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss

Setting up TailwindCSS:
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup
VSCode Extensions:
Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
Reccomended VS Code Settings:
'files.associations' settings to always open .css files in Tailwind CSS mode; top drop down menu -> file -> preferences -> settings or 'ctrl' + ',' search 'files: association' -> add item -> items: *.css Value: tailwind.css
  #after doing above, tailwindcss will now work in .css files (no more yellow warnings for the entire project!)
"files.associations":  {
  "*.css: "tailwindcss"
  }
'editor.quickSuggestions' =   top drop down menu -> file -> preferences -> settings or 'ctrl' + ',' search 'editor.quickSuggestions' -> add item -> strings: on
#by default VScode will not trigger completions when editing string content, updating the 'editor.quickSuggestions' settings may improve your experience, autosuggestions in strings
"editor.quickSuggestions': {
  "strings": true
}

Daisy UI Configuration:
https://daisyui.com/docs/install/
DaisyUI is a components libarary, that has components prebuilt that are already configured, buttons, modal dialogues, progress bar, custom themes, theme generator - copy paste into tailwind file
https://daisyui.com/theme-generator/
Cool random generator for color palletes, or you can use a prebuilt like synthwave, I went with what was recomended
'tailwindconfig.js' #add below code to it, delete 'theme:' block
module.exports = {
  //...
  plugins: [require("daisyui")],
}
instead of hardcoding, if you set up a theme, you can change it all at once from one file, good to set up before you start coding, going with default for now wasted too much time fiddling around with palletes
after DaisyUI import, deleted everything from 'globals.css', except lines at top @tailwind
next, we need to import our automatic class ordering with tailwindcss and prettier, we already installed, but need to add to plugin to our prettier config
https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
go into 'root' folder and create a new file called 'prettier.config.js' and added below code
module.exports = {
    plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],
  } 
installed 'prettier - code formatter' extension
to make default for editing: top drop down File -> Preferences -> Settings - Change from 'none' to 'Prettier'

Error: Fixed:
Create file called .babelrc in your root directory and add this code:
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"],
  "plugins": []
}
And in .eslintrc, replace the existing code with:

{
  "extends": ["next/babel","next/core-web-vitals"]
}

For Future Sean: Prettier and ESlint can conflict, that's why you need to do the above fix every time you use it,
https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint#prettier
Installed ESLint extension aswell,
Next installed 'Prisma' extension, an ORM , it works with our MongoDB, will help us set up our schema file and gives us autocompletion, and helps with formatting
npm i zod #final package we need to install for our project,

opengraph-image.png #downloaded for tut, the file needs that exact name and MUST be in src / app folder, it is used for the display image on pages like facebook
Now it's time to set up MongoDB:
https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database
we already have an account from our last project, top left drop down -> New Project - NextJS-E-Commerce
MongoDB is good because they take care of a lot of things you would otherwise need to set up for yourself, such as replicas and switches, additional backup servers
created our first DB;DB name: ecommerce / Collection Name: products
added in our first product manually, by clicking 'INSERT DOCUMENT' in top right, Dummy Data Schema Below:
_id:65f87c86d239b4b6af147de7 ObjectId
name:"Product Name" String
description: "Product Description" String
imageUrl: "https://product-image.com: String
price:999 Int32
Floats are inacurrate, so we created our price as an integer32
Prisma(what we are using to work with our DB):
