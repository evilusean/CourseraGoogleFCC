tailwind css

npx create-next-app@latest
typescript: yes / eslint: yes / ESLint: yes / TailwindCSS: yes / src/directory: yes / AppRouter: yes / import alias: no
'npm run dev' to test if setup was successful localhost:3000

Installing prerequisite packages:
npm i daisyui prisma @prisma/client next-auth @auth/prisma-adapter prettier eslint-config-prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss

Setting up TailwindCSS:
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup
VSCode Extensions:
Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
Reccomended VS Code Settings:
'files.associations' settings to always open .css files in Tailwind CSS mode; top drop down menu -> file -> preferences -> settings or 'ctrl' + ',' search 'files: association' -> add item -> items: *.css Value: tailwind.css
  #after doing above, tailwindcss will now work in .css files (no more yellow warnings for the entire project!)
"files.associations":  {
  "*.css: "tailwindcss"
  }
'editor.quickSuggestions' =   top drop down menu -> file -> preferences -> settings or 'ctrl' + ',' search 'editor.quickSuggestions' -> add item -> strings: on
#by default VScode will not trigger completions when editing string content, updating the 'editor.quickSuggestions' settings may improve your experience, autosuggestions in strings
"editor.quickSuggestions': {
  "strings": true
}

Daisy UI Configuration:
https://daisyui.com/docs/install/
DaisyUI is a components libarary, that has components prebuilt that are already configured, buttons, modal dialogues, progress bar, custom themes, theme generator - copy paste into tailwind file
https://daisyui.com/theme-generator/
Cool random generator for color palletes, or you can use a prebuilt like synthwave, I went with what was recomended
'tailwindconfig.js' #add below code to it, delete 'theme:' block
module.exports = {
  //...
  plugins: [require("daisyui")],
}
instead of hardcoding, if you set up a theme, you can change it all at once from one file, good to set up before you start coding, going with default for now wasted too much time fiddling around with palletes
after DaisyUI import, deleted everything from 'globals.css', except lines at top @tailwind
next, we need to import our automatic class ordering with tailwindcss and prettier, we already installed, but need to add to plugin to our prettier config
https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
go into 'root' folder and create a new file called 'prettier.config.js' and added below code
module.exports = {
    plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss'],
  } 
installed 'prettier - code formatter' extension
to make default for editing: top drop down File -> Preferences -> Settings - Change from 'none' to 'Prettier'

Error: Fixed:
Create file called .babelrc in your root directory and add this code:
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"],
  "plugins": []
}
And in .eslintrc, replace the existing code with:

{
  "extends": ["next/babel","next/core-web-vitals"]
}

For Future Sean: Prettier and ESlint can conflict, that's why you need to do the above fix every time you use it,
https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint#prettier
Installed ESLint extension aswell,
Next installed 'Prisma' extension, an ORM , it works with our MongoDB, will help us set up our schema file and gives us autocompletion, and helps with formatting
npm i zod #final package we need to install for our project,

opengraph-image.png #downloaded for tut, the file needs that exact name and MUST be in src / app folder, it is used for the display image on pages like facebook
Now it's time to set up MongoDB:
https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database
we already have an account from our last project, top left drop down -> New Project - NextJS-E-Commerce
MongoDB is good because they take care of a lot of things you would otherwise need to set up for yourself, such as replicas and switches, additional backup servers
created our first DB;DB name: ecommerce / Collection Name: products
added in our first product manually, by clicking 'INSERT DOCUMENT' in top right, Dummy Data Schema Below:
_id:65f87c86d239b4b6af147de7 ObjectId
name:"Product Name" String
description: "Product Description" String
imageUrl: "https://product-image.com: String
price:999 Int32
Floats are inacurrate, so we created our price as an integer32

34:00=============================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Prisma(what we are using to work with our DB):
https://www.prisma.io/
'npx prisma init' #will initialize prisma, creates a .env file with database URL placeholder, replace that string with the connect string from MongoDB
'npx prisma db pull' #we can tell prisma to pull the dummy data we added to our collection and add a schema from that data, so we don't have to set it up ourselves.
introspection = infers the db from the data you already have input in the DB
createdAt DateTime @default(now()) #creates a timestamp when data is created
@@map("products") #will map our model with a different name(Product) to the ecommerce.products of our DB
'npx prisma db push' #changes will be applied to our MongoDB from our schema code
'npx prisma generate' #will generate a prisma client, which you can use to call different DB operations on, whenever you make changes to schema, you need to regenerate your prisma client
  import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
  const prisma = new PrismaClient()
Getting Prisma to work with NextJS:
https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/help-and-troubleshooting/help-articles/nextjs-prisma-client-dev-practices

45:00==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================
After introspecting our schema, we can now delete our dummy data
'npm run dev' #time to start building
created a new folder in src / app / add-product 'page.tsx' routing will load this automatically, we can navigate to it through localhost:3000/add-product
Error: Fixed = had to delete babl.rc and remove next/babel from config file, was causing a problem
Error: Our Tailwind classes are not working Fixed: added below code to 'tailwind.config.js'
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */

48:00==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================
className = "" #used by tailwind to style different elements and components
we get autocompletion with our tailwind VSCode extension, you can hover over the individual items in className to see what each one does with detail
'Shift' + 'Alt' + F = shortcut to reorder all classes in correct order(windows only, doesn't work on linux)
Daisy UI components:
https://daisyui.com/components/input/
What daisy UI does is it already has pre-styled all tailwindCSS components, so you don't need to do it manually, you can search for whatever component you need above, and hover over to see tailwindCSS inputs in VSCode
<input className="mb-3 w-full input input-bordered" /> #will create a rounded box input with predesigned tailwindCSS from daisyUI with custom classNames we searched up
'layout.tsx' is the root layout, where all styling will be applied to every page in your app, which returns your components/pages as children 
<main className="p-4 max-w-7xl m-auto min-w-[300px]"> #created a new main tag that will apply styling of padding and max-width/min width[with a custom value] and auto-margin center to all of our pages

60:00==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================
export const metadata = {
    title: "Add Product"
} #overrides the default metadata in our 'layout.tsx' file, will change the title but only for the page where we put the 'export const metadata'
when we submit the form, we want to store a new product in our database, 1) turn it into a client component so we can execute JS, 2)take input of form and send by a fetch to server endpoint and add a product to a DB
  you can't make server operations on the client, because it exposes the DB credentials on the client, why you must route connections like this over a server 
NextJS Server Actions:
https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations
Next JS server actions will allow you to a way to do server mutation directly through components without having to set up a server endpoint, just put a function inside of component and you can alter DB
Error : Cannot find name 'redirect'.
