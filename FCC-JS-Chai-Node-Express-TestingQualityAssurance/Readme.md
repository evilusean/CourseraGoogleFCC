As your programs or web applications become more complex, you'll want to test them to make sure that new changes don't break their original functionality.

In the Quality Assurance Certification, you'll learn how to write tests with Chai to ensure your applications work the way you expect them to.

Then you'll build a chat application to learn advanced Node and Express concepts. You'll also use Pug as a template engine, Passport for authentication, and Socket.io for real-time communication between the server and connected clients.


Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai :
Chai is a JavaScript testing library that helps you confirm that your program still behaves the way you expect it to after you make changes to your code.

Using Chai, you can write tests that describe your program's requirements and see if your program meets them.

In this course, you'll learn about assertions, deep equality, truthiness, testing APIs, and other fundamentals for testing JavaScript applications.
