npm run dev #this worked
https://github.com/sominator/multiplayer-card-project/tree/master/client/src/assets #remove defaults, add to 'public/assets'
In the '/client/src' directory, add a folder called "scenes" and another called "helpers."
In '/client/src/scenes', add an empty file called "game.js".
In '/client/src/helpers', add three empty files: "card.js", "dealer.js", and "zone.js".
'/src/index.js', which is the main entry point to our front end app. #this doesn't work, syntax changed, use 'main.js'
utilize Phaser's "scene" system so that we can separate our game scenes rather than try to cram everything in one file. 
  Scenes can be useful if you're creating multiple game worlds, building things like instruction screens, or generally trying to keep things tidy.
