1: Comment Your JavaScript Code :
Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. 
Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.
There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:
Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:
// This is an in-line comment.
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */. This is a multi-line comment:
/* This is a
multi-line comment */
NOTE: As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your codeâ€”both for others and for your future self.

2: Declare JavaScript Variables :
In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides eight different 
data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.
For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", 
  which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.
Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.
Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to.
Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.
We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:
var ourName;
creates a variable called ourName. 
In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName.
Hint Look at the ourName example above if you get stuck.

3: Storing Values with the Assignment Operator :
In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).
myVariable = 5;
This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.
If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.
var myVar;
myVar = 5;
First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is 5.
Assign the value 7 to variable a.

4: Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another:
After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.
var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;
The above declares a myVar variable with no value, then assigns it the value 5. Next, a variable named myNum is declared with no value. 
Then, the contents of myVar (which is 5) is assigned to the variable myNum. Now, myNum also has the value of 5.
Assign the contents of a to variable b.

5: Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator :
It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.
var myVar = 0;
Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.
Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.

6: Declare String Variables:
Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:
var myName;
But you can also declare a string variable like this:
var myName = "your name";
"your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

7: Understanding Uninitialized Variables:
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. 
If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". 
If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined.
Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.

8:Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.
MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing.
It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.
Best Practice : Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in 
lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
Examples:
var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;
Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.
Do not create any new variables.

9: Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords :
One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations:
var camper = "James";
var camper = "David";
console.log(camper);
In the code above, the camper variable is originally declared as James, and is then overridden to be David. The console then displays the string David.
In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem. But as your codebase becomes larger, 
  you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to. Because this behavior does not throw an error,
  searching for and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.
A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, to solve this potential issue with the var keyword. 
You'll learn about other ES6 features in later challenges.
If you replace var with let in the code above, it results in an error:
let camper = "James";
let camper = "David";
The error can be seen in your browser console.
So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.
Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.

10:Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword:
The keyword let is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.
const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only.
They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:
const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs";
The console will display an error due to reassigning the value of FAV_PET.
You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the const keyword. 
This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant.
Note: It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays). 
You will learn more about objects, arrays, and immutable and mutable values in later challenges. Also in later challenges, you will see examples of uppercase,
lowercase, or camelCase variable identifiers.
Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const. Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to 
remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices. Do not change the strings assigned to the variables.

11:Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.
Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.
JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.
Example:
const myVar = 5 + 10;
myVar now has the value 15.
Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.

12: Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
We can also subtract one number from another.
JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.
Example
const myVar = 12 - 6;
myVar would have the value 6.
Change the 0 so the difference is 12.

13:Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
We can also multiply one number by another.
JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.
Example
const myVar = 13 * 13;
myVar would have the value 169.
Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.

14:Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
We can also divide one number by another.
JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.
Example
const myVar = 16 / 2;
myVar now has the value 8.
Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.

15:Increment a Number with JavaScript
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.
i++;
is the equivalent of
i = i + 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.
Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.

16:Decrement a Number with JavaScript
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.
i--;
is the equivalent of
i = i - 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.
Change the code to use the -- operator on myVar.

17:Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.
Note: when you compute numbers, they are computed with finite precision. Operations using floating points may lead to different results than the desired outcome.
If you are getting one of these results, open a topic on the freeCodeCamp forum.
Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).

18:Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.
Let's multiply two decimals together to get their product.
Change the 0.0 so that product will equal 5.0.

19:Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript
Now let's divide one decimal by another.
Change the 0.0 so that quotient will equal to 2.2.

20:Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
Example
5 % 2 = 1
5 / 2 = 2 remainder 1
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1
Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2. 
Even numbers have a remainder of 0, while odd numbers a remainder of 1.
17 % 2 = 1
48 % 2 = 0
Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. 
It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.
Set remainder equal to the remainder of 11 divided by 3 using the remainder (%) operator.

21:Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. 
Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:
myVar = myVar + 5;
to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.
One such operator is the += operator.
let myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
6 would be displayed in the console.
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.

22:Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.
myVar = myVar - 5;
will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:
myVar -= 5;
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.

23:Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.
myVar = myVar * 5;
will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:
myVar *= 5;
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.

24:Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?
In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.
const sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";
This signals to JavaScript that the following quote is not the end of the string, but should instead appear inside the string. 
So if you were to print this to the console, you would get:
Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript".
Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:
I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

25:Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote.
Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.
const doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string"; 
const singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';
The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string. 
This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation in quotes. 
Another use for it would be saving an <a> tag with various attributes in quotes, all within a string.
const conversation = 'Finn exclaims to Jake, "Algebraic!"';
However, this becomes a problem if you need to use the outermost quotes within it. Remember, a string has the same kind of quote at the beginning and end. 
But if you have that same quote somewhere in the middle, the string will stop early and throw an error.
const goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?"'; 
const badStr = 'Finn responds, "Let's go!"';
Here badStr will throw an error.
In the goodStr above, you can use both quotes safely by using the backslash \ as an escape character.
Note: The backslash \ should not be confused with the forward slash /. They do not do the same thing.
Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and end and no escape characters.
Right now, the <a> tag in the string uses double quotes everywhere. You will need to change the outer quotes to single quotes so you can remove the escape characters.

26:Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. Escape sequences allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to use in a string.
Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\t	tab
\r	carriage return
\b	backspace
\f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.
Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.
FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine
You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly. 
You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces between escape sequences or words.
Note: The indentation for SecondLine is achieved with the tab escape character, not spaces.

27:Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator.
You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.
Example
'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.
Example:
const ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
The string I come first. I come second. would be displayed in the console.
Build myStr from the strings This is the start. and This is the end. using the + operator. Be sure to include a space between the two strings.

28:Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.
Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.
Example:
let ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
ourStr now has a value of the string I come first. I come second..
Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: This is the first sentence. and This is the second sentence. 
using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown in the example and be sure to include a space between the two strings. 
Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string.

29:Constructing Strings with Variables
Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.
Example:
const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.
Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings My name is  and  and I am well!

30:Appending Variables to Strings
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.
Example:
const anAdjective = "awesome!";
let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
ourStr would have the value freeCodeCamp is awesome!.
Set someAdjective to a string of at least 3 characters and append it to myStr using the += operator.

31:Find the Length of a String
You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.
console.log("Alan Peter".length);
The value 10 would be displayed in the console. Note that the space character between "Alan" and "Peter" is also counted.
For example, if we created a variable const firstName = "Ada", we could find out how long the string Ada is by using the firstName.length property.
Use the .length property to set lastNameLength to the number of characters in lastName.

32:Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String
Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.
Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.
For example, the character at index 0 in the word Charles is C. So if const firstName = "Charles",
you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].
Example:
const firstName = "Charles";
const firstLetter = firstName[0];
firstLetter would have a value of the string C.
Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.
Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

33:Understand String Immutability
In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
For example, the following code will produce an error because the letter B in the string Bob cannot be changed to the letter J:
let myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";
Note that this does not mean that myStr could not be re-assigned. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new value, like this:
let myStr = "Bob";
myStr = "Job";
Correct the assignment to myStr so it contains the string value of Hello World using the approach shown in the example above.

34:Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.
Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.
Example:
const firstName = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.
Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.
Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

35:Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String
In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.
For example, if const firstName = "Ada", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].
Example:
const firstName = "Ada";
const lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
lastLetter would have a value of the string a.
Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.
Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.
