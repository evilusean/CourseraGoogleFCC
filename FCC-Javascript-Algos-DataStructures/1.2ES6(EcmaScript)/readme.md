ES6: </br>
ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript.  </br>
Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable. </br>
Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009.  </br>
While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year. </br>
ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this course, you'll learn these new features,  </br>
including arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules. </br>
