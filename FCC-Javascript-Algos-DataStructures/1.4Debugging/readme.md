Debugging :</br>
Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them.</br>
Issues in code generally come in three forms: syntax errors that prevent your program from running, </br>
runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior, or logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.</br>
In this course, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen.</br>
