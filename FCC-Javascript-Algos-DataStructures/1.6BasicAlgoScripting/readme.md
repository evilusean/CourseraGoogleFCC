Basic Algorithm Scripting : </br>
An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something. </br>
To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and think carefully about how to solve each part with code. </br>
In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.</br>
