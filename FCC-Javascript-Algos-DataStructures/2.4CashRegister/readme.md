Build a Cash Register Project:
Here you'll build a cash register app that will return change to the customer based on the price of the item, the amount of cash provided by the customer, and the amount of cash in the cash drawer.</br>
 You'll also need to show different messages to the user in different scenarios, such as when the customer provides too little cash or when the cash drawer doesn't have enough to issue the correct change.</br>

There are a few variables you'll need to use in your code:</br>
price: the price of the item as a floating point number.</br>
cash: the amount of cash provided by the customer for the item, which is provided via an input element on the page.</br>
cid: cash-in-drawer, a 2D array listing available currency in the cash drawer.</br>
If you'd like to test your application with different values for price and cid, make sure to declare them with the let keyword so they can be reassigned by our tests.</br>

Your application should show different messages depending on the price of the item, the amount of cash provided by the customer, and the amount of cash in the drawer:
