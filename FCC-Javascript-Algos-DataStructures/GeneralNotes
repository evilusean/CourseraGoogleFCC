1.1 ================================================================================================================ Basic Javascript:
// This is an in-line comment.
/* This is a
multi-line comment */

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:
var ourName;
creates a variable called ourName. 
In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.

In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).
myVariable = 5;
This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.
var myVar = 0;
Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.
