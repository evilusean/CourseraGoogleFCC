1:00 = Reverse a String / Int : =============================================================================================================
Do the string first, because once you can reverse a string, you can easily reverse an integer.
All you would have to do is convert the integer into a string, do the reversal and convert it back into an integer
node 1-reverse-string.js #To test our code, use node. Be sure to cd to correct directory 'Exercises-Completed'
First test worked,
function reverse(str) {
let reversed = "";
for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) { #while the for loop is less than the length of str, i++
reversed = str[i] + reversed; #will go through each and add one by one the characters of the reversed string
}
return reversed;
}
// Built in Function way of doing it : Array.prototype.reverse() # can only be used on arrays, convert a string into an array and do the reverse.
//Will need to convert into an array, then convert back into a str/integer
