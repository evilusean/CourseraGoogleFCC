For Laravel development on Arch Linux, users typically opt for alternative solutions such as:
Laravel Homestead:
A pre-packaged Vagrant box providing a complete development environment with PHP, Nginx, databases, and other services within a virtual machine.
https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/homestead
https://github.com/laravel/homestead
Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box designed to provide a convenient and consistent development environment for Laravel applications. 
  It eliminates the need to manually install and configure server software like PHP, Nginx, MySQL, and other tools directly on your local machine.
Arch Linux Homestead Install :
sudo pacman -S vagrant 
sudo pacman -S virtualbox
git clone https://github.com/laravel/homestead.git ~/.local/share/homestead
cd ~/.local/share/homestead
git checkout release
bash init.sh
Configure Homestead.yaml: Open the generated ~/.local/share/homestead/Homestead.yaml file and configure it to your needs. 
  This includes setting the provider to virtualbox and mapping your project directories
Add a hosts file entry: Edit your /etc/hosts file with sudo and add an entry that maps your site's domain to the Homestead IP address (e.g., 192.168.10.10).
Installing Laravel Homestead on Arch Linux involves a few key steps. Since Homestead is a pre-configured Vagrant box, 
  you'll first need to install Vagrant and a virtualization provider like VirtualBox.
Open the generated ~/.local/share/homestead/Homestead.yaml file and configure it to your needs. This includes setting the provider to virtualbox and mapping your project directories.
YAML
provider: virtualbox
folders:
    - map: ~/Projects/MyProject
      to: /home/vagrant/MyProject
sites:
    - map: myproject.test
      to: /home/vagrant/MyProject/public
Add a hosts file entry:
Edit your /etc/hosts file with sudo and add an entry that maps your site's domain to the Homestead IP address (e.g., 192.168.10.10).
sudo nano /etc/hosts
# Add this line to the end of the file
192.168.10.10 myproject.test
Launching Homestead :
After all the configurations are complete, you can launch your virtual machine.
Navigate to the Homestead directory:
cd ~/.local/share/homestead
Start the virtual machine:
vagrant up # The first time you run this, Vagrant will download the pre-packaged Laravel Homestead box, which may take some time.
Access the VM: Once it's up, you can SSH into the virtual machine.
vagrant ssh
Manual setup:
Installing and configuring PHP, Nginx (or Apache), Composer, and any required databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) directly on the Arch Linux system.
Docker:
Utilizing Docker containers to create isolated and portable development environments for Laravel projects.
Therefore, while Laravel Herd is a powerful tool for its intended platforms, it cannot be directly installed or used on Arch Linux. 
  Users on Arch Linux should explore the alternative methods mentioned above for setting up their Laravel development environment.
Arch Linux Install (with SQLite) :
sudo pacman -Syu #update system, reboot
sudo pacman -S php php-fpm php-gd php-intl #install all php prerequisites
sudo pacman -S composer #install composer
sudo pacman -S php-sqlite #project will use sqlite
sudo nano /etc/php/php.ini # After installation, you need to enable the extension in your php.ini file. 
# Find the lines for the SQLite extensions and uncomment them by removing the semicolon ; at the beginning of each line. ';extension=pdo_sqlite' ';extension=sqlite3' 
sudo systemctl restart php-fpm #Restart the PHP-FPM service for the changes to take effect.
composer global require laravel/installer # Use Composer to install the Laravel installer globally.
#Add the Composer vendor bin directory to your system's PATH. This allows you to run the laravel command from any directory. The path is typically ~/.config/composer/vendor/bin on Arch Linux.
nano ~/.bashrc # Add the following line to the end of the file: 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"'
source ~/.bashrc #resource, so you can use 'laravel' in terminal anywhere
laravel new your-project-name # will allow you to now create a new project
