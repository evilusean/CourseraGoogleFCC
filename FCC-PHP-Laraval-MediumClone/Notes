Course teaches Basic Setup, Advanced Features : User Following, Post Management, Routing, Authentication, Database Operations, Blade Templating
You can see when the posts are published, when, by whom, likes, estimated read time, date published, category, filter by categories, search by user posts/profiles, followers  
create post requires : an image, title, category, content, publish date
profile page : change avatar, username, email, bio, password

0:05:35 - Setup Environment & Create Project ==================================================================================================================================================
Setup Environment - Laravel Herd (NGINX, PHP 8.4, MySQL, Redis) Only for windows and mac : 
https://herd.laravel.com/windows
Herd downloads the latest version of PHP-Laravel, NodeJS, NPM, NVM(node version manager), NGINX
When you open herd, it brings you to a dashboard to view your active services : open sites, general overview, paths, PHP versions, Node versions, 
Create a new project in herd from the dashboard -> 'open sites' -> '+Add'
  You can choose to use either React, Vue, or Livewiere for your new project, Name it, and that's it
Testing Frameworks : Pest Vs PHPUnit
For Laravel development on Arch Linux, users typically opt for alternative solutions such as:
Laravel Homestead:
A pre-packaged Vagrant box providing a complete development environment with PHP, Nginx, databases, and other services within a virtual machine.
https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/homestead
https://github.com/laravel/homestead
Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box designed to provide a convenient and consistent development environment for Laravel applications. 
  It eliminates the need to manually install and configure server software like PHP, Nginx, MySQL, and other tools directly on your local machine.
Arch Linux Homestead Install :
sudo pacman -S vagrant 
sudo pacman -S virtualbox
git clone https://github.com/laravel/homestead.git ~/.local/share/homestead
cd ~/.local/share/homestead
git checkout release
bash init.sh
Configure Homestead.yaml: Open the generated ~/.local/share/homestead/Homestead.yaml file and configure it to your needs. 
  This includes setting the provider to virtualbox and mapping your project directories
Add a hosts file entry: Edit your /etc/hosts file with sudo and add an entry that maps your site's domain to the Homestead IP address (e.g., 192.168.10.10).
Installing Laravel Homestead on Arch Linux involves a few key steps. Since Homestead is a pre-configured Vagrant box, 
  you'll first need to install Vagrant and a virtualization provider like VirtualBox.
Open the generated ~/.local/share/homestead/Homestead.yaml file and configure it to your needs. This includes setting the provider to virtualbox and mapping your project directories.
YAML
provider: virtualbox
folders:
    - map: ~/Projects/MyProject
      to: /home/vagrant/MyProject
sites:
    - map: myproject.test
      to: /home/vagrant/MyProject/public
Add a hosts file entry:
Edit your /etc/hosts file with sudo and add an entry that maps your site's domain to the Homestead IP address (e.g., 192.168.10.10).
sudo nano /etc/hosts
# Add this line to the end of the file
192.168.10.10 myproject.test
Launching Homestead :
After all the configurations are complete, you can launch your virtual machine.
Navigate to the Homestead directory:
cd ~/.local/share/homestead
Start the virtual machine:
vagrant up # The first time you run this, Vagrant will download the pre-packaged Laravel Homestead box, which may take some time.
Access the VM: Once it's up, you can SSH into the virtual machine.
vagrant ssh
Manual setup:
Installing and configuring PHP, Nginx (or Apache), Composer, and any required databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) directly on the Arch Linux system.
Docker:
Utilizing Docker containers to create isolated and portable development environments for Laravel projects.
Therefore, while Laravel Herd is a powerful tool for its intended platforms, it cannot be directly installed or used on Arch Linux. 
  Users on Arch Linux should explore the alternative methods mentioned above for setting up their Laravel development environment.
Arch Linux Install (with SQLite) :
sudo pacman -Syu #update system, reboot
sudo pacman -S php php-fpm php-gd php-intl #install all php prerequisites
sudo pacman -S composer #install composer
sudo pacman -S php-sqlite #project will use sqlite
sudo nano /etc/php/php.ini # After installation, you need to enable the extension in your php.ini file. 
# Find the lines for the SQLite extensions and uncomment them by removing the semicolon ; at the beginning of each line. ';extension=pdo_sqlite' ';extension=sqlite3' 
sudo systemctl restart php-fpm #Restart the PHP-FPM service for the changes to take effect.
composer global require laravel/installer # Use Composer to install the Laravel installer globally.
#Add the Composer vendor bin directory to your system's PATH. This allows you to run the laravel command from any directory. The path is typically ~/.config/composer/vendor/bin on Arch Linux.
nano ~/.bashrc # Add the following line to the end of the file: 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"'
source ~/.bashrc #resource, so you can use 'laravel' in terminal anywhere
laravel new your-project-name # will allow you to now create a new project 
laravel new FCC-MediumClone # new project, options : No Toolkit(react, etc), SQLite, NPM install, npm run build 
ERROR : Node is outdated, need version > 20, currently on 16 (did a 'sudo pacmna -Syu' yesterday so idk, need to fix)
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash #install script for NVM
yay -s nvm # idk which one worked
nvm ls-remote --lts # this was the fix, I installed version 20 globally, but my project was running 16(?) so I had to run these commands in the IDE terminal
nvm install <version_number>
nvm alias default <version_number>
Finally got everything working, took a day just to setup environment, 
VSCode vs PHPStorm - He's going over the IDE's - He reccomends PHP Storm, paid app, too poor, maybe future Sean might want. 
https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/ 
VSCode Extensions : 'PHP - Devsense'(Has PHP syntax highlighting, autocomplete, etc) 'Laravel - Laravel' (Official VSCode Extension for Laravel)

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AtomMaterial.a-file-icon-vscode
'npm install' #the drill
'composer run dev' # how to start the server on linux
  This will not work on windows without editing the 'php.ini' file, since I will never use windows again, I never have to worry about this 'EGPCS' -> 'GCPS'
  Vite server runs with it, 
'npm run dev' # for windows and mac, linux should user 'composer run dev'

0:15:03 - Explore Directory Structure ======================================================================================================================================================
'app' folder = contains 'Http' (Controller.php) 
  'Models' (User.php) 
  'Providers' (AppServiceProvider.php)
'bootstrap' folder = contains 
  'cache' 
  'app.php' (this is the main file which initializes the application, confirguration with routing, 'create' method) 
  'providers.php'
'config' folder = contains every file needed for configuration
'database' = contains 'factories' (UserFactory.php = defines each field when new data is input, can also create unique dummy data)
  'migrations' (contains 3 migrations to begin with, a migration is a file which contains the DB schema change, instead of doing it manually use a migration, commit and push)
  'seeders' (DatabaseSeeder.php)
  'database.sqlite' (main file for tables/data)
'seeders' folder = contains 'DatabaseSeeder.php' (creates data in database)
'public' folder = contains all web accesible files, like 'favicon', 'robots.txt'
  'index.php' (the entry script, everything starts from index.php, whenever you access the app in the browser, everything get's accessed from index.php, loads packages, 
  uses 'bootstrap/app.php' to create the app

'php artisan make --help' # --help flag tells you what a command does, and shows you all the commands that can be used with it
Artisan is your main tool for Laravel-PHP, you can use it to create files, create caches, etc

0:23:22 - Laravel Configuration ============================================================================================================================================================= 
'.env' # contains your main laravel configurations and not just your API keys in PHP-Laravel
'config' folder has all the other configurations 'app.php' 'auth.php' 'cache.php' 'database.php' ..... etc, each one corresponds with the config for it's name
if you aren't going to make any changes to the 'config' folder files, you can delete them, the config files already exist in laravel core, and if they aren't there,
  the framework will use the laravel core versions, if you only modify one part of one 'config -> _.php' file you can delete everything else in that file aswell, and laravel will use default
'php artisan config:publish' # will allow you to use your new config files, if the file isn't in the 'config' folder, it will create it and you can edit it 

0:26:27 - Create Basic Route ================================================================================================================================================================== 
'routes -> web.php' 
<?php //this is a opening tag for PHP. It is a special marker that tells the web server that the code that follows is to be interpreted as PHP and not as plain HTML.
// The 'Route' facade is a class provided by the framework (e.g., Laravel)
// that simplifies the process of defining application routes.
// The 'get' method registers a new route that responds only to
// HTTP GET requests. This is the most common type of request, used
// by web browsers to fetch a page.
// The first argument, '/hello', is the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
// that the application will listen for. When a user visits this path,
// the code inside the function is executed.
Route::get('/hello', function() {
    return 'Hello, World!';
    // This is an anonymous function (or closure) that acts as the
    // handler for the route. This function is executed when the
    // URI '/hello' is requested with a GET method.
    // The 'return' statement sends the specified value back as the
    // HTTP response. The framework automatically takes this plain string
    // and sends it to the user's web browser, which will then
    // display "Hello, World!" on the screen.
}); // will return 'Hello, World!' as plain text on the browser screen
// The 'Route' facade is used to register a new route for the application.
// The 'get' method specifies that this route should handle HTTP GET requests.
// The first argument, '/', is the URI. This is a special case that
// represents the root of the website (e.g., [your-website.com/](https://your-website.com/)).
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome'); // 'welcome' will automatically fetch 'welcome.blade.php' and you don't need to type out the entire folder structure and file name
    // This is the function that will be executed when a user visits
    // the root URL.
    // The 'return' statement sends the result of the 'view()' function
    // back to the user.
    // The 'view()' function is a helper function that tells the framework
    // to find and render an HTML file (called a "view").
    // The argument 'welcome' tells the framework to look for a file
    // named 'welcome.blade.php' (or similar) inside the 'resources/views'
    // directory. The content of that file will be rendered as the
    // final web page.
}); // will return a view instead of just plaintext, you can construct entire web pages as views in the file format '_.blade.php' 

0:28:01 - Registration & Login (Laravel Breeze) =============================================================================================================================================
'composer require laravel/breeze' # will require and install breeze package, which has everything you need for authentication : registration, login, email verification, password resets, etc
'php artisan breeze:install' # installs breeze into your project (select 'Blade with Alpine' so you don't introduce any new frameworks, 'No' darkmode, 'Pest' Tests) 
  #the above command will update composer.json, package.lock, add tonnes of files(scaffolding) for login, auth, etc, 
'composer run dev' # you will now see 2 new buttons at the top of your screen 'Login' 'Register', pretty cool, 2 commands to set up auth/login/registration/profile/etc
'views -> welcome.blade.php' will be updated with the new buttons, it literally does all the heavy lifting.... with 2 commands, I had to hook up nothing to the backend, 
  No email services, no databases, no third parties, no building authentication/login/email/etc pages, it just works... actually pretty cool.
'views -> dashboard.blade.php' # this is what shows when you have a succesful login
'views -> auth -> _.blade.php' # adds all the new files/views for your project, automatically, saving days of work, I can see why people like PHP now
  'login.blade.php' 'register.blade.php' 'confirm-password.blade.php' 'forgot-password.blade.php' 'reset-password.blade.php' 'verify-email.blade.php' 
'views -> components -> _.blade.php' # all components for auth were added here 'danger-button.blade.php' 'dropdown.blade.php' etc
'views -> layouts -> app.blade.php' # layout for authenticated users
'views -> layouts -> guest.blade.php' # this is the layout for unauthenticated users 
'views -> layouts -> navigation.blade.php' # navigation for authenticated users
'views -> partials -> edit.blade.php' # allows you to edit your user profile, split into 3 components, update password, profile and delete user form
# the reason why all this is so cool, is it does the heavy lifting for you, this would all take days to do manually, all you do is set up the scaffolding, and then make it look pretty
'routes -> auth.php' # added with the command, controllers(which do all of the requests like authentication, registration, posts, requests, gets, etc)
'routes -> web.php' # automatically updated with all the new routes, adds the routes from auth.php automatically added for 'view/get' 'update' 'delete'

0:33:31 - Email Verification ================================================================================================================================================================
I'm adding detailed comments for each controller, because I had no idea what was going on before, I actually want to learn PHP, so I might as well learn about this part now, for future Sean
https://github.com/evilusean/CourseraGoogleFCC/tree/main/FCC-PHP-Laraval-MediumClone/FCC-MediumClone/app/Http/Controllers/Auth
A class in PHP is very similar to a class in Java. Both are core components of object-oriented programming (OOP).
What is a Class?
Think of a class as a blueprint or a template for creating things called objects. It defines a set of properties (variables) and methods (functions) that an object of that class will have.
For example, if you have a 'Car' class, the blueprint might define properties like 'color', 'make', and 'model', and methods like 'startEngine()' or 'accelerate()'.

    // This route handles displaying the registration form.
    // 'get' means it responds to a browser navigating to '/register'.
    // '[RegisteredUserController::class, 'create']' specifies that the 'create' method
    // on the 'RegisteredUserController' class will handle this request.
    // '->name('register')' gives this route a unique, human-readable name. This is very
    // useful for generating URLs in your code (e.g., redirecting to 'register').

When setting up our account originally out of the box, we were able to create a new user without email verification, you need to enable this in 'app -> Models -> User.php'
change this line in 'User.php' = 'class User extends Authenticatable' -> 'class User extends Authenticatable implements MustVerifyEmail' 
  to add email verification, that's all you need to do, one line, amazing
'.env' go to 'MAIL_MAILER=log' # this shows us that our mail is added to log file 'storage -> logs -> laravel.log' - every email sent out will be stored here, 
  after checking the logs, you can see the verify email address link and click it from the log to verify an account (even if it's a fake email account) and use account
MailPit (free way to test your apps with email auth/registration) :
https://mailpit.axllent.org/
https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/
https://mailpit.axllent.org/docs/install/
'yay -S mailpit-bin' #install on arch linux
after installing mailpit, type 'mailpit' in a terminal, it will give you 'http://localhost:8025/' that you can open in a browser to access the emails, now...
  to get emails sent to it instead of the log file go to '.env' and change 'MAIL_MAILER=log' -> 'MAIL_MAILER=smtp' and change 'MAIL_PORT=1025'
