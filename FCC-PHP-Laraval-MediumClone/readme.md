Laravel is a popular PHP web development framework known for its elegant syntax, developer-friendly tools, and built-in features for routing, authentication, and database interactions. It's an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers looking to create full-featured web applications quickly and efficiently.

Build a fully-functional Medium clone using the Laravel PHP framework. This in-depth, hands-on course takes you from setting up your Laravel environment to developing advanced features like user profiles, following/unfollowing other users, and managing blog posts. By the end, you'll not only understand Laravel's core features but also how to put them together to build a real-world social publishing platform.

Throughout the course, you'll explore key Laravel concepts such as models, migrations, factories, and seeders, and you'll make use of Blade templating, components, and layouts to build dynamic and reusable UI elements. You’ll also build critical features like post creation and editing, pagination, category filtering, image uploads and resizing, and user interactions such as liking posts and following other users.
