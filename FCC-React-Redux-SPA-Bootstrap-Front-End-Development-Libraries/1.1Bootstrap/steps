Step 1:
Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers
In the HTML5 and CSS section of freeCodeCamp we built a Cat Photo App. Now let's go back to it. This time, we'll style it using the popular Bootstrap responsive 
CSS framework.
Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design.
With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.
You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" 
integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>
In this case, we've already added it for you to this page behind the scenes. Note that using either > or /> to close the link tag is acceptable.
To get started, we should nest all of our HTML (except the link tag and the style element) in a div element with the class container-fluid.

Step 2:
Make Images Mobile Responsive
First, add a new image below the existing one. Set its src attribute to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg.
It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen.
Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your image.
Do this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page.
