SASS
Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. </br>
It adds features that aren't available in basic CSS, which make it easier for you to simplify and maintain the style sheets for your projects. </br>
In this Sass course, you'll learn how to store data in variables, nest CSS, create reusable styles with mixins, add logic and loops to your styles, and more. </br>
