Redux : </br>
As applications grow in size and scope, managing shared data becomes much more difficult. </br>
Redux is defined as a "predictable state container for JavaScript apps" that helps ensure your apps work predictably, and are easier to test.</br>
While you can use Redux with any view library, we introduce Redux here before combining it with React in the next set of courses.</br>
In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of Redux stores, actions, reducers and middleware to manage data throughout your application.</br>
