React and Redux : </br>
React and Redux are often mentioned together, and with good reason. </br>
The developer who created Redux was a React developer who wanted to make it easier to share data across different components.</br>
Now that you know how to manage the flow of shared data with Redux, it's time to combine that knowledge with React. </br>
In the React and Redux courses, you'll build a React component and learn how to manage state locally at the component level, </br>
and throughout the entire application with Redux. </br>
