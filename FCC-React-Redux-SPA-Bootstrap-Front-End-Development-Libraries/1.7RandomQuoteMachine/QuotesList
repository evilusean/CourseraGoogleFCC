I have never once in my life sean a succesful protest, they do a temporary retreat at BEST, and come back in with a new law/bill/tax to do the same thing later "let them march all they want, as long as they pay their taxes" -Alexander Haig
your so called '"representatives"' don't represent you. Just wait until the cops/enforcers finally realize that they aren't getting their penseans, that's when the 'fun' starts. Where did it go? '"Who"' took it?
We're all just going through the MoSeans - waiting for the honking to start. I can't wait to see where '"they"' run to this time, after sanctioning/bombing/looting/poisoning over half the world, small world after all. F(r)IEND vs nME
ImmigrateSean is a DistractSean from the true perpetrators, they want you looking laterally instead of vertically. Sure, they don't help, but '"Who"' let them all in? '"Who"' gave them preferential treatment? Cui Bono?
Frederic Bastiat - The Law - tonnes of goodies, need to reread my highlighted text to find them quickly, especially in current year current day, with current '"leaders"'
"“One of the strangest phenomena of our time, and one that will probably be a matter of astonishment to our descendants, is the doctrine which is founded upon this triple hypothesis:
the radical passiveness of mankind,— the omnipotence of the law,—the infallibility of the legislator: this is the sacred symbol of the party that proclaims itself exclusively democratic.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
"When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men in a society, over the course of time they create for themselves a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it."
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“When law and morality contradict each other, the citizen has the cruel alternative of either losing his moral sense or losing his respect for the law.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“Everyone wants to live at the expense of the state. They forget that the state lives at the expense of everyone.”
― Frederick Bastiat
“The politician attempts to remedy the evil by increasing the very thing that caused the evil in the first place: legal plunder.”
― Frédéric Bastiat
“The safest way to make laws respected is to make them respectable.”
― Frédéric Bastiat
“I cannot possibly understand how fraternity can be legally enforced without liberty being legally destroyed...”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“We now observe this fatal idea: The people who, during the election, were so wise, so moral, and so perfect, now have no tendencies whatever; or if they have any, they are tendencies that lead downward into degradation.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“As long as these ideas prevail, it is clear that the responsibility of government is enormous. Good fortune and bad fortune, wealth and destitution, equality and inequality, 
virtue and vice – all then depend upon political administration.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“The law has gone further than this; it has acted in direct opposition to its own purpose. The law has been used to destroy its own objective: 
It has been applied to annihilating the justice that it was supposed to maintain; to limiting and destroying rights which its real purpose was to respect. 
The law has placed the collective force at the disposal of the unscrupulous who wish, without risk, to exploit the person, liberty, and property of others.
It has converted plunder into a right, in order to protect plunder. And it has converted lawful defense into a crime, in order to punish lawful defense.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“The most urgent necessity is not that the State should teach, but that it should allow education. All monopolies are detestable, but the worst of all is the monopoly of education.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Bastiat Collection
“What is freedom? It is the sum total of freedoms. To be free, under one’s own responsibility, to think and act, to speak and write, to work and trade, to teach and learn, that alone is to be free.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“when plunder is abetted by the law, it does not fear your courts, your gendarmes, and your prisons. Rather, it may call upon them for help.”
― Frederick Bastiat, The Law
"Those who would give up Essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."
-Benjamin Franklin
“The last official act of any government is to loot the treasury.”
— George Washington

"When you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing - 
When you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors - 
When you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don't protect you against them, but protect them against you -
When you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice - 
You may know that your society is doomed."
— Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged, 1957
