"Rules for thee not for mee" "DO ALL THE THINGS - now they are all illegal - Appeal 2 Govt" -Hippie gone yuppie generasean "Weak men create hard times" - Jboomers, the so called 'men' who created the current hard times. 
JBoomers used govt to enforce a set of morals they themselves never actually possessed - Hypocrites - blaME the victIM - 
I don't think normies are capable of differentiating TV shows from reality, instead of reading a book on WWII they will watch 'Pearl Harbor with matt damon' and be like - welp, I guess that's how it was -.- they are so dumb, it's painful

"DomesticASean vs CivilizeASean - are they civilized or domesticated? so called 'civil' soyciety"
"the sooner you stop viewing them as '"our"' countries, and start viewing them as hostile foreign occupaySeans, the sooner things start to make Seanse."

'The "they voooted for this" types - Nope, not one time was it ever put up for a vote. Politician get's bribed/blackmailed, politician does a thing, voting doesn't matter. You (S)elect a representative every 4 years. We Were Never Asked.
  None of the laws that get passed are ever voooted on by the populace aeffected by them, Noone asked for or wanted millions of indians, yet here they are. Are you going to clean that up? I'm not. Skin in the game vs moral hazard. 
  Canada is unique in that rats are fleeing into a sinking ship, only people who grew up next to the polluted fetid ganges(gangrene) so called holy river would look at canada as a nice place, worth moving too. Kala Pani. New Slave Class. 
  The natives are getting restless? Bring in new natives. Compliant Yes-Men, HofPooDen, Meant to distract from the actual lever pullers. A literal horde, wall of bodies between the aggrieved and the guilty. We can just go around.
Use your ImageinaSean for a few moments, what would happen in a highly population dense area, in -40 degree weather and the power goes out for 3 days? a week? a month? months? Ya'll MF's will be eating eachother. The Walking Dead. 
Hurricane Katrina, countless examples throughout history, the past ~100 years of holding hands and singing kumbaya are the anomaly. Once the food, fuel, and paychecks stop, so does the artificial peace, prepare accordingly.
'that will never happen in current year!' - Let's look towards haiti, barbecue - warlords, with roving cannibal gangs, they don't even have the racial animosity component, hutu's and the tutsi's, another example. 
I've completely removed the racial component with the above 2 examples, now imagine a group of people(s) who have been fed CRT / 'anti-colonial' propaganda for 30+ years, mao's red gaurd, the social media/drug addicted youths, 
I personally don't want to deal with that, people are tribal, and my supposed so called 'allies' have only done one thing, consistently and regularly betray me at every opportunity when it's politically/socially convenient (always).
I'm seeking higher ground, away from you idiots, enjoy cleaning up your own mess for the first time in your life, I'm going to go hang around the smart people, and laugh from a safe distance, because if you don't, you cry. 
your so called '"representatives"' don't represent you. Just wait until the cops/enforcers finally realize that they aren't getting their penseans, that's when the 'fun' starts. Where did it go? '"Who"' took it?
We're all just going through the MoSeans - waiting for the honking to start. I can't wait to see where '"they"' run to this time, after sanctioning/bombing/looting/poisoning over half the world, small world after all. F(r)IEND vs nME
ImmigrateSean is a DistractSean from the true perpetrators, they want you looking laterally instead of vertically. Sure, they don't help, but '"Who"' let them all in? '"Who"' gave them preferential treatment? Cui Bono? Qui? QUI!?
'The "you won't do sh!t" types are simply trying to instigateSean to AxSean, force your hand while they still have some semblance of legitimaSean, and crush you with full state power, while they have it. further perpetuating it'
  -They are living on literally borrowed time, stolen from the future through odious debts. We literally don't have to lift a finger for it all to collapse, when it does, THEN you can make your moves, It's a mathematical certainty. P<P+I 
"They always need a boogie man, fear is control, unfortunately for them they jabbed the most fearful and ignorant among us, while creating a new purity test further illegitimizeASean every instituSean remaining - vaxcattle authorities."
I have never once in my life sean a succesful protest, they do a temporary retreat at BEST, and come back in with a new law/bill/tax to do the same thing later - totalitarian tiptoe, 2 steps forward, 1 step back -
The protestors get bored/tired/have work - go home - politicSean says platitudes, wait a few months/years, do it again. It's all so tiresome. "let them march all they want, as long as they pay their taxes" -Alexander Haig
Frederic Bastiat - The Law - tonnes of goodies, need to reread my highlighted text to find them quickly, especially in current year current day, with current '"leaders"'
"“One of the strangest phenomena of our time, and one that will probably be a matter of astonishment to our descendants, is the doctrine which is founded upon this triple hypothesis:
the radical passiveness of mankind,— the omnipotence of the law,—the infallibility of the legislator: this is the sacred symbol of the party that proclaims itself exclusively democratic.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
"When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men in a society, over the course of time they create for themselves a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it."
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“When law and morality contradict each other, the citizen has the cruel alternative of either losing his moral sense or losing his respect for the law.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“Everyone wants to live at the expense of the state. They forget that the state lives at the expense of everyone.”
― Frederick Bastiat
“The politician attempts to remedy the evil by increasing the very thing that caused the evil in the first place: legal plunder.”
― Frédéric Bastiat
“The safest way to make laws respected is to make them respectable.”
― Frédéric Bastiat
“I cannot possibly understand how fraternity can be legally enforced without liberty being legally destroyed...”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“We now observe this fatal idea: The people who, during the election, were so wise, so moral, and so perfect, now have no tendencies whatever; or if they have any, they are tendencies that lead downward into degradation.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“As long as these ideas prevail, it is clear that the responsibility of government is enormous. Good fortune and bad fortune, wealth and destitution, equality and inequality, 
virtue and vice – all then depend upon political administration.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“The law has gone further than this; it has acted in direct opposition to its own purpose. The law has been used to destroy its own objective: 
It has been applied to annihilating the justice that it was supposed to maintain; to limiting and destroying rights which its real purpose was to respect. 
The law has placed the collective force at the disposal of the unscrupulous who wish, without risk, to exploit the person, liberty, and property of others.
It has converted plunder into a right, in order to protect plunder. And it has converted lawful defense into a crime, in order to punish lawful defense.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“The most urgent necessity is not that the State should teach, but that it should allow education. All monopolies are detestable, but the worst of all is the monopoly of education.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Bastiat Collection
“What is freedom? It is the sum total of freedoms. To be free, under one’s own responsibility, to think and act, to speak and write, to work and trade, to teach and learn, that alone is to be free.”
― Frédéric Bastiat, The Law
“when plunder is abetted by the law, it does not fear your courts, your gendarmes, and your prisons. Rather, it may call upon them for help.”
― Frederick Bastiat, The Law
"Those who would give up Essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."
-Benjamin Franklin
“The last official act of any government is to loot the treasury.”
— George Washington

"When you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing - 
When you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors - 
When you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don't protect you against them, but protect them against you -
When you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice - 
You may know that your society is doomed."
— Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged, 1957
