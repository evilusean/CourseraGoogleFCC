Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design.
With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.
You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" 
integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>

Make Images Mobile Responsive
First, add a new image below the existing one. Set its src attribute to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg.
It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen.
Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your image.

Create a Bootstrap Button
Bootstrap has its own styles for button elements, which look much better than the plain HTML ones.
Create a new button element below your large kitten photo. Give it the btn and btn-default classes, as well as the text of Like.
<button class="btn btn-default">Like</button> 
Normally, your button elements with the btn and btn-default classes are only as wide as the text that they contain.
By making them block elements with the additional class of btn-block, your button will stretch to fill your page's entire horizontal space and any 
elements following it will flow onto a "new line" below the block.
<button class="btn btn-default btn-block">Submit</button>
