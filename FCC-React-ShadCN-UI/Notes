if you are using shadcn, you should always install it at the begining of the development process, if you use the same naming conventions like naming a folder 'components' shadcn will overwrite it on install
'npm run build' #build for testing
'npm run dev' #start the testing server

ShadCN Accordian = 3:35 ==================================================================================================================================================================================================================
First Component :
https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion
Accordion = Dropdown list when clicked, with smooth animations
ShadCN Components will have a preview, After looking at the preview and deciding you want that component, you can then scroll down to the 'Installation' either through the CLI or Manual 
  After installing it, you can alter it to suit your own needs, 
npx shadcn-ui@latest add accordion #will install accordian through CLI, will create a components folder in 'src/app/components/ui/accordion.tsx'
'tailwind.config.js' #after installing the component, you will need to update tailwindcss.config for the keyframes(animation) copy and paste can be found on 'https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion'
'import' after installing the component, and updating tailwindconfig, add the import, copy and paste can be found on 'https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion'
'usage' after insstalling the component, and updating tailwindconfig, and adding the import, it will show you how to add the new component to your project/app (below is example)
<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="item-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>Is it accessible?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Yes. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
Created new folder for building components, 'src/app/SHADCN/' and used React snippet 'rfce' to create a functional component
