Step 1
HTML elements have opening tags like <h1> and closing tags like </h1>.
The text for an element goes between its opening and closing tags.
Find the h1 element and change its text to:
CatPhotoApp

Step 2
The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, 
  so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.
Below the h1 element, add an h2 element with this text:
Cat Photos

Step 3
The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. Create a p element below your h2 element and give it the following text:
See more cat photos in our gallery.

Step 4
Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. 
  A comment in HTML starts with <!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->. For example, the comment <!-- TODO: Remove h1 --> 
  contains the text TODO: Remove h1.
Add a comment above the p element with this text:
TODO: Add link to cat photos

Step 5
HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and 
  accessibility.
Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag before the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag after the p element.
