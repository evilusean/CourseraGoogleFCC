Step 1
By now, you should be familiar with the basic elements an HTML page should have.
Set up your code with a DOCTYPE declaration, an html element with the language set to English, a head element, and a body element.

Step 2
Within the head element, add a meta tag which sets the charset to UTF-8, and a title element with the value Rothko Painting.
Within the body element, add an img element with a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-1.png.

Step 3
In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.
Imagine you receive a box from your favorite online retailer -- the content is the item in the box, or in our case, a header, paragraph, or image element.
Change the src attribute in the <img> from https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-1.png to 
https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-2.png.

Step 4
The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it.
Think of the border like the cardboard box your item was shipped in.
Change the src attribute to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-box-model/diagram-3.png

Step 5
Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements.
Here the bottom element has a larger top margin, pushing it further down the page.
Now that you understand the CSS box model, let's get started on the Rothko painting.
Remove the <img> element.
