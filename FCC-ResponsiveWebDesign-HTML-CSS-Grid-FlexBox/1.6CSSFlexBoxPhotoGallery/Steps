Step 1
Begin with your standard HTML boilerplate. Add a DOCTYPE declaration, an html element, a head element, and a body element.
Add the lang attribute to the opening <html> tag with en set as the value.

Step 2
Within your head element, add a meta tag with the name set to viewport and the content set to width=device-width, initial-scale=1.
Also add a meta tag with the charset set to UTF-8.

Step 3
Within your head element, add a title element with the text set to Photo Gallery, and a link element to add your styles.css file to the page.

Step 4
Add a header element within the body element and assign a class of header to it.
Inside the header, create an h1 with css flexbox photo gallery as the text.

Step 5
Below your .header element, create a new div element and assign it a class of gallery. This div will act as a container for the gallery images.
Inside that .gallery element, create nine img elements.
