Step 1
We've provided a basic HTML boilerplate for you.
Create an h1 element within your body element and give it the text Nutrition Facts.

Step 2
Below your h1 element, add a p element with the text 8 servings per container.

Step 3
Add a second p element with the text Serving size 2/3 cup (55g).

Step 4
Within your head element, add a link element with the rel attribute set to stylesheet and the 
href attribute set to https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700,800.
This will import the Open Sans font family, with the font weight values 400, 700, and 800.
Also add a link element to link your styles.css file.

Step 5
Create a body selector and give it a font-family set to Open Sans with a fallback of sans-serif.
Remember that fonts with spaces in the name must be wrapped in quotes for CSS.
