Step 1
We've provided a basic HTML boilerplate for you.
Create an h1 element within your body element and give it the text Nutrition Facts.

Step 2
Below your h1 element, add a p element with the text 8 servings per container.

Step 3
Add a second p element with the text Serving size 2/3 cup (55g).

Step 4
Within your head element, add a link element with the rel attribute set to stylesheet and the 
href attribute set to https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700,800.
This will import the Open Sans font family, with the font weight values 400, 700, and 800.
Also add a link element to link your styles.css file.

Step 5
Create a body selector and give it a font-family set to Open Sans with a fallback of sans-serif.
Remember that fonts with spaces in the name must be wrapped in quotes for CSS.

Step 6
The font is a bit small. Create an html selector and set the font to have a size of 16px.

Step 7
Wrap your h1 and p elements in a div element. Give that div a class attribute set to label.

Step 8
Borders can be used to group and prioritize content.
Create a .label selector and give it a border set to 2px solid black.

Step 8
Borders can be used to group and prioritize content.
Create a .label selector and give it a border set to 2px solid black.

Step 9
Good use of white space can bring focus to the important elements of your page, and help guide your user's eyes through your text.
Give your .label selector a width property set to 270px.

Step 10
Give your .label selector a margin property set to 20px auto, and a padding property set to 0 7px.
