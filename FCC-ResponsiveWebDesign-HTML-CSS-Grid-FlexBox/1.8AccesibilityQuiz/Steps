Step 1
Welcome to the first part of the Accessibility Quiz. As you are becoming a seasoned HTML and CSS developer, we have started you off with the basic boilerplate.
Start this accessibility journey by providing a lang attribute to your html element. This will assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page.

Step 2
You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.
Give your page a meta element with an appropriate charset value.
The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers.

Step 3
Continuing with the meta elements, a viewport definition tells the browser how to render the page. 
Including one betters visual accessibility on mobile, and improves SEO (search engine optimization).
Add a viewport definition with a content attribute detailing the width and initial-scale of the page.

Step 4
Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is the description definition. 
The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.
Add a meta element with the name attribute set to description, and give it a useful content attribute.

Step 5
Lastly in the head, the title element is useful for screen readers to understand the content of a page. Furthermore, it is an important part of SEO.
Give your page a title that is descriptive and concise.
