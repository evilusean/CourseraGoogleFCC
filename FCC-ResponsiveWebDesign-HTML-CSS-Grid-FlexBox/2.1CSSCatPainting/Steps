Step 1
Begin with the basic HTML structure. Add a DOCTYPE reference of html and an html element with its lang attribute set to en. Also,
add a head and a body element within the html element.

Step 2
Within your head element, add a meta tag with the charset attribute of utf-8. Also add a title element with the text fCC Cat Painting.

Step 3
Add a link element within your head element. For that link element, set the rel attribute to stylesheet and the href to ./styles.css.

Step 4
Use the universal selector to add box-sizing: border-box; to your CSS. This ensures elements include padding and border in their specified width and height.

Step 5
Give your body element a background-color of #c9d2fc.

Step 6
Back in your HTML, create a main element. Inside that main element, add a div element with the class cat-head.

Step 7
Using a class selector, give the .cat-head element a width of 205px and a height of 180px. Also, give it a border of 1px solid #000 and a border-radius of 46%.

Step 8
To see the cat-head element, give it a linear gradient background with #5e5e5e at 85% and #45454f at 100%.
You might not notice the difference between these two colors, but they are there.

Step 9
CSS positioning lets you set how you want an element to be positioned in the browser. It has a position property you can set to static, absolute, relative,
sticky or fixed.
Once you set the position property of the element, you can move the element around by setting a pixel or a percentage value for one or more of the top,
right, left, or bottom properties.
static is the default positioning for all elements. If you assign it to an element, you won't be able to move it around with top, right, left, or bottom.
Give .cat-head a position property of static, then set the top and left properties to 100px each.

Step 10
You could see that nothing happens. The .cat-head element did not move despite setting a top and left of 100px each. 
But that's not the case with relative positioning.
When you use the relative value, the element is still positioned according to the normal flow of the document, but the top, left, 
bottom, and right values become active.
Instead of static, give your .cat-head a position of relative, and leave both top and left properties as they are.
