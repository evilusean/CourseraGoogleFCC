Step 1
Begin with the basic HTML structure. Add a DOCTYPE reference of html and an html element with its lang attribute set to en. Also,
add a head and a body element within the html element.

Step 2
Within your head element, add a meta tag with the charset attribute of utf-8. Also add a title element with the text fCC Cat Painting.

Step 3
Add a link element within your head element. For that link element, set the rel attribute to stylesheet and the href to ./styles.css.

Step 4
Use the universal selector to add box-sizing: border-box; to your CSS. This ensures elements include padding and border in their specified width and height.

Step 5
Give your body element a background-color of #c9d2fc.
