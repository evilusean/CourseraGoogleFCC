<!--
The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each)
You can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar"
The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the
     topic of the technical documentation
Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There 
    should be one for every element with the class main-section
The header element in the #navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar
Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header 
    text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar 
    should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")
When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section 
    of the #main-doc element (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the 
    text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id, and contains 
    the corresponding header)
On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown 
    on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user
Your technical documentation should use at least one media query
Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your
     own personal style. Happy Coding!
Note: Be sure to add <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> in your HTML to link your 
    stylesheet and apply your CSS-->
