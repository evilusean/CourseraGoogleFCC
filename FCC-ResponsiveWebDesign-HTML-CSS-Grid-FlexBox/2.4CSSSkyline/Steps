Step 1
Welcome to the CSS Variables Skyline project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser 
knows what type of document it's reading.

Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have a place to start putting some code. Be sure to set the language to English.

Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element.

Step 4
Within the head, nest a meta element with a charset of UTF-8, a title element with a title of City Skyline, and a link element that links your styles.css file.

Step 5
In CSS, you can target everything with an asterisk. Add a border to everything by using the * selector, and giving it a border of 1px solid black. 
This is a trick that helps visualize where elements are and their size. You will remove this later.

Step 6
Also add a box-sizing of border-box to everything. This will make it so the border you added doesn't add any size to your elements.

Step 7
You can see the body (it's the inner-most box on your page); the box around it is the html element. 
Make your body fill the whole viewport by giving it a height of 100vh. Remove the default margin from the body by setting the margin to 0. Finally, 
set the overflow property to hidden to hide any scroll bars that appear when something extends past the viewport.

Step 8
Create a div element in the body with a class of background-buildings. This will be a container for a group of buildings.

Step 9
Give your .background-buildings element a width and height of 100% to make it the full width and height of its parent, the body.

Step 10
Nest a div with a class of bb1 in the background buildings container. Open your styles.css file, and give .bb1 a width of 10% and height of 70%.
"bb" stands for "background building", this will be your first building.
