Step 1
Welcome to the CSS Variables Skyline project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser 
knows what type of document it's reading.

Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have a place to start putting some code. Be sure to set the language to English.

Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element.

Step 4
Within the head, nest a meta element with a charset of UTF-8, a title element with a title of City Skyline, and a link element that links your styles.css file.

Step 5
In CSS, you can target everything with an asterisk. Add a border to everything by using the * selector, and giving it a border of 1px solid black. 
This is a trick that helps visualize where elements are and their size. You will remove this later.

Step 6
Also add a box-sizing of border-box to everything. This will make it so the border you added doesn't add any size to your elements.

Step 7
You can see the body (it's the inner-most box on your page); the box around it is the html element. 
Make your body fill the whole viewport by giving it a height of 100vh. Remove the default margin from the body by setting the margin to 0. Finally, 
set the overflow property to hidden to hide any scroll bars that appear when something extends past the viewport.

Step 8
Create a div element in the body with a class of background-buildings. This will be a container for a group of buildings.

Step 9
Give your .background-buildings element a width and height of 100% to make it the full width and height of its parent, the body.

Step 10
Nest a div with a class of bb1 in the background buildings container. Open your styles.css file, and give .bb1 a width of 10% and height of 70%.
"bb" stands for "background building", this will be your first building.

Step 11
Nest four div elements in the .bb1 container. Give them the classes bb1a, bb1b, bb1c, and bb1d in that order. This building will have four sections.

Step 12
Give the parts of your building width and height properties with these values: 70% and 10% to .bb1a, 80% and 10% to .bb1b, 90% and 10% to .bb1c, 
and 100% and 70% to .bb1d. Remember that these percentages are relative to the parent and note that the heights will add up to 100% - vertically 
filling the container.

Step 13
Center the parts of your building by turning the .bb1 element into a flexbox parent. Use the flex-direction and align-items properties to center the children.

Step 14
Now you have something that is resembling a building. You are ready to create your first variable. Variable declarations begin with 
two dashes (-) and are given a name and a value like this: --variable-name: value;. In the rule for the bb1 class, create a variable named 
--building-color1 and give it a value of #999.

Step 15
To use a variable, put the variable name in parentheses with var in front of them like this: var(--variable-name). 
Whatever value you gave the variable will be applied to whatever property you use it on.
Add the variable --building-color1 you created in the previous step as the value of the background-color property of the .bb1a class.
