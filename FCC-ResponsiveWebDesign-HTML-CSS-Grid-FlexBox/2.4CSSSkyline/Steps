Step 1
Welcome to the CSS Variables Skyline project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser 
knows what type of document it's reading.

Step 2
Add opening and closing html tags below the DOCTYPE so you have a place to start putting some code. Be sure to set the language to English.

Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element.

Step 4
Within the head, nest a meta element with a charset of UTF-8, a title element with a title of City Skyline, and a link element that links your styles.css file.

Step 5
In CSS, you can target everything with an asterisk. Add a border to everything by using the * selector, and giving it a border of 1px solid black. 
This is a trick that helps visualize where elements are and their size. You will remove this later.
