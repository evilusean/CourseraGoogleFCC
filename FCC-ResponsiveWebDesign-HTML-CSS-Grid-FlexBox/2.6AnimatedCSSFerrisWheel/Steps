Step 1
Begin with the standard boilerplate. Add your DOCTYPE declaration, your html element with the language set to English, your head and body elements.
Add your meta element for the correct charset, your title element, and a link element for the ./styles.css file.
Set the title to Ferris Wheel.

Step 2
Add a div within your body element and give it a class of wheel.
Inside your new div, add six span elements with a class set to line, and six div elements with a class set to cabin.

Step 3
Create a selector for your .wheel element. Start by setting the border to 2px solid black, the border-radius to 50%, and the margin-left to 50px.

Step 4
Set the position property of the .wheel selector to absolute. Set the height and width both to 55vw.

Step 5
Give your .wheel selector a max-height and max-width property both set to 500px.
