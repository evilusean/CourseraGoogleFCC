Step 1
You will be building a happy Flappy Penguin, and further exploring CSS transforms and animations in the process.
Begin with your basic HTML boilerplate. Include the DOCTYPE declaration, html element with a language set to English, the appropriate meta tags,
a head, body, and title element. Also, link your stylesheet to the page.

Step 2
Target the body element to set the background to a linear gradient angled 45 degrees clockwise, starting at rgb(118, 201, 255) and ending at rgb(247, 255, 222).

Step 3
Normalise your page's sizing, by removing the body element's margin and padding.

Step 4
Normalise your page, by setting the width to 100%, and height to 100vh.

Step 5
Remove both the horizontal and vertical scrollbars, using only one property.

Step 6
Within the body, add a div with a class of ground.

Step 7
Target the .ground element, and set its width to take up the full width of the viewport. Then, set the height to 400px.

Step 8
Give the .ground element a background with a linear gradient angled 90 degrees clockwise, starting at rgb(88, 175, 236) and ending at rgb(182, 255, 255).

Step 9
As the .ground element will be third in the stacking context of the page layout, set its z-index to 3, and position to absolute.

Step 10
Above the .ground element, add a div with a class of penguin. This div will contain Flappy Penguin.

Step 11
Target the .penguin element, and set its width and height to 300px.

Step 12
Use the margin property to horizontally center the .penguin element, and set the margin-top to 75px.

Step 13
To create some scenery in the background, you will add two mountains.
Above the .penguin element, add a div with a class of left-mountain.

Step 14
Target the .left-mountain element, and set its width and height to 300px.
Then, set the background to a linear gradient starting at rgb(203, 241, 228) and ending at rgb(80, 183, 255).

Step 15
To prevent the mountain from pushing the .ground element, adjust its position to prevent it from taking up space in the page layout.
