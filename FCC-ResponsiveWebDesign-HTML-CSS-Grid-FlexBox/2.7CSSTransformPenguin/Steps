Step 1
You will be building a happy Flappy Penguin, and further exploring CSS transforms and animations in the process.
Begin with your basic HTML boilerplate. Include the DOCTYPE declaration, html element with a language set to English, the appropriate meta tags,
a head, body, and title element. Also, link your stylesheet to the page.

Step 2
Target the body element to set the background to a linear gradient angled 45 degrees clockwise, starting at rgb(118, 201, 255) and ending at rgb(247, 255, 222).

Step 3
Normalise your page's sizing, by removing the body element's margin and padding.

Step 4
Normalise your page, by setting the width to 100%, and height to 100vh.

Step 5
Remove both the horizontal and vertical scrollbars, using only one property.

Step 6
Within the body, add a div with a class of ground.

Step 7
Target the .ground element, and set its width to take up the full width of the viewport. Then, set the height to 400px.

Step 8
Give the .ground element a background with a linear gradient angled 90 degrees clockwise, starting at rgb(88, 175, 236) and ending at rgb(182, 255, 255).

Step 9
As the .ground element will be third in the stacking context of the page layout, set its z-index to 3, and position to absolute.

Step 10
Above the .ground element, add a div with a class of penguin. This div will contain Flappy Penguin.
