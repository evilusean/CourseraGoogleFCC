Step 1
You will be building a happy Flappy Penguin, and further exploring CSS transforms and animations in the process.
Begin with your basic HTML boilerplate. Include the DOCTYPE declaration, html element with a language set to English, the appropriate meta tags,
a head, body, and title element. Also, link your stylesheet to the page.

Step 2
Target the body element to set the background to a linear gradient angled 45 degrees clockwise, starting at rgb(118, 201, 255) and ending at rgb(247, 255, 222).

Step 3
Normalise your page's sizing, by removing the body element's margin and padding.

Step 4
Normalise your page, by setting the width to 100%, and height to 100vh.

Step 5
Remove both the horizontal and vertical scrollbars, using only one property.
