HTML elements have opening tags like <h1> and closing tags like </h1>.
The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, 
  so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.
The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. 
Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. 
  A comment in HTML starts with <!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->. For example, the comment <!-- TODO: Remove h1 --> 
  contains the text TODO: Remove h1.
HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and 
  accessibility.
Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag before the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag
elements inside the main element. This is called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further
  to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.
You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. 
A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.
HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's
  URL (where the image is located).
All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.
You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element. For example, <a href='https://freecodecamp.org'></a> would link to freecodecamp.org.
A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element. 
You can turn any text into a link, such as the text inside of a p element. <p>I think <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a> is great.</p>
Before adding any new content, you should make use of a section element to separate the cat photos content from the future content.
Use list item (li) elements to create items in a list.
A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the figure element. 
For example, <figcaption>A cute cat</figcaption> adds the caption A cute cat.
Emphasize a word in the figcaption element by wrapping it in an emphasis em element.
The code for an ordered list (ol) is similar to an unordered list, but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed.
