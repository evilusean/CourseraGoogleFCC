HTML elements have opening tags like <h1> and closing tags like </h1>.
The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, 
  so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.
The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites. 
Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. 
  A comment in HTML starts with <!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->. For example, the comment <!-- TODO: Remove h1 --> 
  contains the text TODO: Remove h1.
HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and 
  accessibility.
Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag before the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag
elements inside the main element. This is called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further
  to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.
You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. 
A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.
HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's
  URL (where the image is located).
All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.
You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element. For example, <a href='https://freecodecamp.org'></a> would link to freecodecamp.org.
A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element. 
You can turn any text into a link, such as the text inside of a p element. <p>I think <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a> is great.</p>
Before adding any new content, you should make use of a section element to separate the cat photos content from the future content.
Use list item (li) elements to create items in a list.
A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the figure element. 
For example, <figcaption>A cute cat</figcaption> adds the caption A cute cat.
Emphasize a word in the figcaption element by wrapping it in an emphasis em element.
The code for an ordered list (ol) is similar to an unordered list, but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed.
After the last img element, add a <figcaption> element with the text Cats hate other cats. Inside the <figure> element
The strong element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent.
Now you will add a web form to collect information from users. add a form element.
The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, 
  <form action="/submit-url"></form> tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url.
The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input elements are self-closing and do not need closing tags.
There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button,
  or a control to let users select a file from their computer.
In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value 
  to represent the data being submitted. For example, you could use the following syntax for an email address text field: <input type="text" name="email">.
Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input. For example, <input type="text" placeholder="Email address">.
To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required attribute to an input element.
  There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Instead, just add the word required to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other
  attributes.
Use the button element to create a clickable button. For example, <button>Click Here</button> creates a button with the text Click Here.
The id attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must be unique from all other id values for the entire page.
The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements meaning that they appear on a new line
The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form.
Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer. For example, here's a checkbox with the option of tacos: <input type="checkbox"> tacos.
There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a label element and add a for attribute with the 
  same value as the input element's id attribute.
Like radio buttons, form data for selected checkboxes are name / value attribute pairs. While the value attribute is optional, it's best practice to include it with
  any checkboxes or radio buttons on the page.
In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute to it. There's no need to set a value to the 
  checked attribute. Instead, just add the word checked to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.
The title element determines what browsers show in the title bar or tab for the page.
<html lang="en">
All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.
You can set browser behavior by adding self-closing meta elements in the head. Here's an example:<meta attribute="value">
