'psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres' #login credentials for tutorial, after signing in, gives you a new prompt 'postgres=>' 
\l # list, while signed into the new postgreSQL db, by using the credentials above, will show a list of all databases
CREATE DATABASE database_name; #a way to create a new database - The capitalized words are keywords telling PostgreSQL what to do. The name of the database is the lowercase word. 
  Note that all commands need a semi-colon at the end. - the keywords are also CAP SENSITIVE, need to be capitalized 
  If you don't get a message after entering a command, it means it's incomplete and you likely forgot the semi-colon.
\c database_name #You can connect to a database by entering \c database_name. You need to connect to add information. , the prompt will change to 'database_name'
\d #display the tables of the currently connected to DB
  \d table_name #You can view more details about a table by adding the table name after the display command like this: \d table_name
CREATE TABLE table_name(); #similar to creating a database, Note that the parenthesis are needed for this one. It will create the table in the database you are connected to
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE; #Tables need columns to describe the data in them, yours doesn't have any yet. Here's an example of how to add one
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name; #will drop a column (delete it)
VARCHAR = A common data type is VARCHAR. It's a short string of characters. You need to give it a maximum length when using it like this: VARCHAR(30).
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name; # Here's how you can rename a column
INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2); # Rows are the actual data in the table. You can add one like this, strings must be in ' single quotes
SELECT columns FROM table_name;  #You can view the data in a table by querying it with the SELECT statement
SELECT * from table_name; #view all data from table_name, '*' = all
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition; #Here's an example of how to delete a row
DELETE FROM second_table WHERE username='Luigi'; #deletes from the 'second_table' the row where username='Luigi', all data on the row where username='Luigi' will be deleted, not just username
DROP TABLE table_name; #will drop(delete) a table from your database
ALTER DATABASE database_name RENAME TO new_database_name; #You can rename a database like this:
ALTER TABLE characters ADD COLUMN character_id SERIAL; #The SERIAL type will make your column an INT with a NOT NULL constraint, and automatically increment the integer when a new row is added.
ALTER TABLE characters ADD COLUMN name VARCHAR(30)NOT NULL; 
  #Add a column to characters called name. Give it a data type of VARCHAR(30), and a constraint of NOT NULL. Add a constraint by putting it right after the data type.
Adding rows one at a time is quite tedious. Here's an example of how you could have added the previous three rows at once:
  INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color)
  VALUES('Mario', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Red'),
  ('Luigi', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Green'),
  ('Peach', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Pink');
UPDATE table_name SET column_name=new_value WHERE condition; # You can change a value like this
SELECT columns FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name; #order columns by 
SELECT * FROM characters ORDER BY character_id; #will order all colums from characters by ascending character_id
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column_name); #  add a primary key. It's a column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Here's an example of how to set a PRIMARY KEY
  You should set a primary key on every table and there can only be one per table.
