'SELECT first_name, last_name, gpa FROM students WHERE gpa < 2.5;' #Use one of these to view the same columns as before but only rows WHERE gpa < 2.5
  You can return only rows you want by adding WHERE <condition> to your query. A condition can consist of a column, an operator, and a value. 
SQL has the operators '<' less than, '>' greater than, '>='greater than equal to, '=' equal to, '!=' not equal
