'student_info.sh' #create a new bash script 
'echo -e "\n~~ My Computer Science Students ~~\n"' #use '-e' flag to add escape characters
'PSQL="psql -X --username=freecodecamp --dbname=students --no-align --tuples-only -c"' #how to query in a bashscript to the postgreSQL DB
'SELECT first_name FROM students;' #to only query one column instead of '*' all 
'SELECT first_name, last_name, gpa FROM students;' #select multiple columns 
'SELECT first_name, last_name, gpa FROM students WHERE gpa < 2.5;' #Use one of these to view the same columns as before but only rows WHERE gpa < 2.5
  You can return only rows you want by adding WHERE <condition> to your query. A condition can consist of a column, an operator, and a value. 
SQL has the operators '<' less than, '>' greater than, '>='greater than equal to, '=' equal to, '!=' not equal
'SELECT * FROM students WHERE last_name < 'M' AND gpa = 3.9;' #you can use the 'AND' keyword to add 2 'WHERE' constraints
'SELECT * FROM students WHERE last_name < 'M' AND gpa = 3.9 OR gpa < 2.3;' #you can also use the 'OR' keyword
'SELECT * FROM courses WHERE course LIKE '_lgorithms';' #you can use '_' for pattern matching regex, it will only match one character
'SELECT * FROM courses WHERE course LIKE '%lgorithms';' #using '%' will match ALL patterns(like a phrase, or a letter, whatever)
'SELECT * FROM courses WHERE course LIKE 'Web%';' #will match anything with 'Web' and anything following it
'SELECT * FROM courses WHERE course LIKE '% %';' #will find any pattern with a space in the name
'SELECT * FROM courses WHERE course NOT LIKE '% %';' #new keyword 'NOT LIKE' where it will find everything that DOESN'T match the pattern, this finds all without a space
'SELECT * FROM courses WHERE course ILIKE '<pattern>';' #another new keyword 'ILIKE' will ignore capitalization
'SELECT * FROM courses WHERE course NOT ILIKE '%A%';' # combining 'NOT' and 'ILIKE' will find any pattern without an A regardless of capitalize
