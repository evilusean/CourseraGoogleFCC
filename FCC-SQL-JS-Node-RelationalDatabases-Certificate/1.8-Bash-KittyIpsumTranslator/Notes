'<command> > <filename>' #how to pipe to a file, with '>' will take the output from a command and send it to a file, if no file exists, it will create it
'echo hello bash > stdout.txt' # will create a new file if none existed, be careful because this will overwrite everything in that file, 'echo' will not be put in the file
'<command> >> <filename>' # '>>' to APPEND to a file, will add it to the end if a file exists and not overwrite
'> stdout.txt' #to redirect nothing into the file, which will empty it
