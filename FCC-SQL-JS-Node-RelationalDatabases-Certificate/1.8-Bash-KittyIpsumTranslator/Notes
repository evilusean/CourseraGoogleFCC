Start : 26March2025 

Clicking the "hamburger" menu near the top left of the VSCode window,
Going to the "View" menu,
Clicking on the "Command Palette" option,
and running the "CodeRoad: Start" command
'<command> > <filename>' #how to pipe to a file, with '>' will take the output from a command and send it to a file, if no file exists, it will create it
'echo hello bash > stdout.txt' # will create a new file if none existed, be careful because this will overwrite everything in that file, 'echo' will not be put in the file
'<command> >> <filename>' # '>>' to APPEND to a file, will add it to the end if a file exists and not overwrite
'> stdout.txt' #to redirect nothing into the file, which will empty it
There’s two types of output, 'stdout' (standard out) for when a command is successful, and 'stderr' (standard error) for when it’s not. 
If you give a bad command to be output to a file, it will not run or be added to the file
'bad_command 2> stderr.txt' #You can redirect stderr with '2>'. Enter the same bad command but redirect stderr to stderr.txt 'bash: bad_command: command not found'
'echo hello bash 1> stdout.txt' #Similarily, you can use '1>' to redirect stdout
'stdin' = stdout and stderr are for output. 'stdin' (standard in) is the third thing commands can use and is for getting input. The default is the keyboard
'command> < <filename_for_stdin>' #Just like you can redirect output, you can redirect stdin as well. Here's an example with '<'
'read NAME < name.txt' #Use the read command to assign the NAME variable to the contents of name.txt by redirecting the stdin. - the '$NAME' variable will be changed to the text in 'name.txt'
