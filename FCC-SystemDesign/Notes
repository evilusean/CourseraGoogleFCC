Computer Architecture - ==================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Computers can only understand binary, compiler abstracted = C abstracted = Python Abstracted = Function/package 
Bit = 0 or 1
Byte = 8 bits
KB = 1024 bytes
MB = 1024 KB
GB = 1024 MB
TB = 1024 GB
Disk Storage = HDD/SSD - Non volatile data storage - HDD Speed = 80 - 160 MB / s - SSD Speed = 500 - 3500 MB / s
RAM = Random Access Memory = Holds data structures, variables, application data that are currently in use or being processed - Volatile memory (needs power) RAM Speed = >5000 MB / s
Cache = Smaller than ram, Cpu first checks L1 Cache -> L2 -> L3 then RAM
CPU = Brain of computer, processes operations, 
Motherboard = Connects everything
