Course Breakdown :
Introduction
The course kicks off with an introduction to system design, setting the stage for the detailed topics that follow.
This section provides an overview of why system design is important and what you can expect to learn.

Computer Architecture :
In this section, you will explore the fundamentals of computer architecture, including disk storage, RAM, cache, and CPU. 
Understanding these components is essential for designing systems that are both efficient and scalable.

Production App Architecture :
Here, the course teaches the architecture of production applications, covering Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), load balancers, and logging & monitoring. 
These concepts are important for maintaining and scaling applications in a real-world environment.

Design Requirements :
This section focuses on the critical design requirements of modern systems. Topics include the CAP Theorem, throughput, latency, and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs). 
These principles help ensure that systems meet their performance and reliability goals.

Networking :
A deep dive into networking covers TCP, UDP, DNS, IP addresses, and IP headers. 
Networking is the backbone of any distributed system, and understanding these protocols is important for designing robust architectures.

Application Layer Protocols :
The course also covers various application layer protocols such as HTTP, WebSockets, WebRTC, and MQTT. These protocols are important for building interactive and real-time applications.

API Design :
Effective API design is crucial for creating scalable and maintainable systems. This section provides guidelines and best practices for designing APIs that are easy to use and efficient.

Caching and CDNs :
Learn about caching mechanisms and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to optimize performance and reduce latency. These techniques are essential for handling high traffic loads and ensuring fast response times.

Proxy Servers :
The course explains the roles of forward and reverse proxy servers in system design. Proxies can enhance security, load balancing, and caching, making them a vital part of modern architectures.

Load Balancers :
Explore different types of load balancers and their importance in distributing traffic across multiple servers.
Load balancers help maintain system reliability and availability.

Databases :
Finally, the course covers database design, including sharding, replication, ACID properties, and vertical and horizontal scaling.
These concepts are important for managing large datasets and ensuring data integrity and availability.
