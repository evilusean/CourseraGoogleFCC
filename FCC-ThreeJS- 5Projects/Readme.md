Three.js abstracts the complexities of WebGL (Web Graphics Library), making it easier for developers to create and display animated 3D computer graphics on a web page. With Three.js,
you can create everything from simple 3D models to complex interactive experiences. </br>

1) Getting Started: </br>
Overview: This project will introduce you to the basics of Three.js. You'll learn how to set up your development environment and create your first 3D scene. </br>
Topics Covered: </br>
Setting up a Three.js project </br>
Creating a scene, camera, and renderer </br>
Adding basic shapes and materials </br>
Lighting and shadows </br>

2) Create the Earth with Three.js </br>
Overview: You'll build a 3D model of the Earth, complete with textures and lighting. </br>
Topics Covered: </br>
Loading and applying textures </br>
Using lighting to enhance realism </br>
Creating and animating the Earth’s rotation </br>

3) Fly through a Wireframe Wormhole: </br>
Overview: This project will teach you how to create a mesmerizing wireframe wormhole effect. </br>
Topics Covered: </br>
Working with wireframe geometries </br>
Animating camera movements </br>
Creating dynamic and interactive animations </br>

4) Create a Transition Effect:  </br>
Overview: Learn how to create smooth transition effects between different scenes or states in your 3D project. </br>
Topics Covered:  </br>
Using shaders for custom effects </br>
Creating seamless transitions </br>
Managing multiple scenes and objects </br>

5) Add Physics to Three.js with Rapier: </br>
Overview: In this final project, you’ll integrate physics into your 3D scenes using the Rapier physics engine. </br>
Topics Covered:  </br>
Setting up Rapier with Three.js </br>
Adding physical properties to objects </br>
Simulating realistic interactions and collisions </br>
