npx @ create-next-app@13.4.13 #creates app in selected folder(run in terminal) uses version 13.4.13, so we don't have any compatibility problems and spend 4 hours debugging every 15 mins(cough... laravel)
added some vscode extensions: ES7 React/Redux/React Native snippets by dsznajder + ESLint + Prettier(formats code on save) + tailwind CSS intelliSense
ctrl+shift+P to open settings menu, go to 'Preferences Open Settings(UI)' and search 'formatter', change Default Formatter to prettier, and check format on save

npm run dev in terminal to start project
start off in global.css, delete all except @tailwind imports
go to page.js, remove everything, now trying out the snippet libary
'rafce' #type rafce to boilerplate a default page
ctrl+shift+L = highlight some text, press ctrl+shift+L and it will highlight all instances of that text, can change all at once
rename all instances of 'page' to 'dashboard'
create new folder in src / app called 'TicketPage', inside is 'page.jsx', also renamed our src / app 'page.js' to 'page.jsx'
Routing in react can work through how you laid out your folder structure
const TicketPage = () => {
  return <div>TicketPage</div>;
};

export default TicketPage;
#will automatically route http://localhost:3000/TicketPage to your 'page.jsx' inside of your 'TicketPage' folder, very cool
created a new folder inside 'TicketPage' folder called [id], moved our 'page.jsx' inside that folder, and added params 
const TicketPage = ({ params }) => {
  return <div>TicketPage {params.id}</div>;
};

export default TicketPage;
#using our new [id] folder, will allow us to type in http://localhost:3000/TicketPage/12345 and it will return a page with 'TicketPage 12345' based on whatever id we input, very nice

if you don't want routing enabled, simply wrap your folder in (parenthesis), such as for our (components) folder we created, it won't set up routing for that
created Nav.jsx in our (components) folder, 'rafce' will create boilerplate code for it
