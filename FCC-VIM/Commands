Motion Commands : Are shortcuts triggered in Normal mode that allow you to quickly move around your document with preceision
  '<#>g' = go to line number <#>
  'w' = go to start of next word
  'b' = move backward a word
Operator Commands: can be used with motion commands:
  'c' = change
  'd' = delete
  'y' = yank (copy)
  '~' = swap case (only if 'tildeop' is set
  'g~' = swap case
  'gu' = make lowercase
  'gq' = text formatting
  '>' = shift right
  '<' = shift left
Examples:
  'd' + 'w' = delete the current word
  'c' + '3" + 'w' = change three words
Directional Motions: 
  'h' = right
  'j' = down 
  'k' = up
  'l' = right
Examples: 
  '10' + 'h' = move 10 characters left
  '25' + 'j' = move down 25 lines

GoTo Motions : Will go to a specific line
  'gg' = go to first line
  'G' = go to the last line
  '22' + 'gg' = go to the 22nd line from the top
  '22' + 'G' = same as above, will go to line 22, using shift 'G' instead of 'gg'
  'gt' = go one tab up
  'gT' = go down one tab

Word Motions : 
  'w' = move to the start of the next word
  'e' = move to the end of the word (will next if already there)
  'b' = moves to the start of the last word
Join Lines: 
  'J' = will join the bottom line with the current line
  '10' + 'J' = Will join the bottom ten lines with the current line
Start or End of Line : (Similar to RegEx with '$' and '^')
  '$' = go to end of line, will remain on the end of line when moving with 'hjkl' movement - sticky positioning
  '^' = go to start of line , will remain on the start of line when moving with 'hjkl' movement - default positioning
Replace Command : Allows you to write overtop of existing characters
  'r' = replace a single character
  'R' = enter Replace Mode, everything typed will replace current text
Undo and Redo Commands : 
  'u' = will undo a text change
  'U' = undo an entire line,
  'Ctrl' + 'r' = Redo - will redo something
Change Command : A way of selecting and then deleting an amount of text based on word motions, will put you in insert mode after deleting
  'c' = change
  'C' = change to end of line (COL), will remove everything from where you are to end of line and put you in insert mode
  'c' + 'w" = change to end of word
  'c' + 'e' = change to end of last word
  'C' + 'gg' = change from here to the first line
  'c' + '2' + 'e' = c2e - will change the next 2 words, will remove everything from where you are and next 2 words and put you in insert mode
  'c' + '5' + 'j" = c5j - will change the next 5 lines from where you are, remove everything and put you in insert mode
Delete Command : Whatever you delete will be placed into the clipboard(unnamed register), so whenever you paste, it will paste what was deleted
  'd' + 'w' = delete from the current cursor to the start of the next word
  'd' + 5 + 'w' = delete the next 5 words
  2 + 'd' + 'w' = delete from the current cursor to start of the next word
  'dd' = delete the current line
  'D' = Delete to end of line (EOL)
  5 + 'dd' = delete five lines
  'x' = delete currently selected character
  4 + 'x' = delete next 4 characters
  'Shift' + P = Paste what is in clipboard(different than control+shift+V)
Yank and Paste Commands : 
  'y' = Will Copy text into the unnamed register(different than 'Ctrl' + 'Shift' + 'V'
  'yw' = yank current word
  'yy' = yank a line
  'Y' = yank current line
  'p' = Paste before(below)
  'P' = Paste after(above)
Insert and Append Commands :
  'i' = will enter insert mode, to the left of the cursor box, allowing you to add text to the document
  'I' = will enter Insert mode, at the start of the line
  'a' = append, will enter insert mode to the right of the cursor
  'A' = Append, at the end of the line, will enter insert mode at end of line
Line Insert Command : Allows you to quickly create a new line above or below the current line and enter insert mode
  'o' = create the new line below and enter insert mode
  'O' = create the new line above and enter insert mode 
Find Command : lets you quickly find and move to a search result (regular expressions work)
  '/' = '/hello' would search forward for the first instance of the word 'hello' in your code
  '?' = '?hello' search backward from the current posiition for word 'hello'
  'n' = next match
  'N' = previous match
  '/hello/s-2' = places the cursor 2 characters before the start of match
  '/hello/e' = places cursor at end of match
  '/hello/e+4' = places cursor at four characters after end of match 
  '/hello/+3' = offsets by 3 lines
Substitute Command : lets you replace text in a file using a regular expression 
  ':.s/hello/world/' = '.' is for current line, will tell you to find all instances of 'hello' and 's' subistitute/replace it with 'world'
  ':2s/hello/world/i' = '2' on line 2 replace all instances of 'hello' and substitute it for 'world' 'i' and ignore casing
  ':2,5s/hello/world/g' = '2,5' for lines 2 to 5, reokace all occurences of 'hello' for 'world' 'g' global means all
  ':1,$s/hello/world/g' = '1,$' from line 1 to the end of document, substitute all instances of the word hello for world 'g' globally all occurences
  '%s/hello/world/g' = short cut for above 
'\' Leader Key : default is '\', used for triggering user or plugin defined shortcuts
  '\cc' = NerdCommenter Plugin, used for commenting out currently selected line(depends on what plugins/scripts you have installed)
  'nnoremap <Leader>b :buffers<CR>:buffer<Space>' = change the 'vimrc' file to remap leader key(or any), in this example to space
Visual Mode - Allows you to select text through either yanking, deleting, or manipulation
  'v' = visual mode will allow you to select multiple characters - press 'v' and then any motion afterwards to select from where your cursor was
  'V' = visual Line Mode =  allows you to select whole line at a time - just move up or down
  'CtrL' + 'v' = visual block mode - allows you to select vertically and by line - press 'c' ('a'/'i' doesnt work) after selecting - so you can add multi line comments or delete multi line
  'c' = c to change(delete currently selected then go to insert mode)
  'y' = yank to unnamed register 
  'p' = to paste from unnamed register
  'gv' = grab last visual mode(if you missclick or lose your last visual mode - will allow you to undo)
Indentation Command : The Leading Whitespace can be adjusted based on tab size(indentation)
  '>' = indent line outward(to the right)
  '<' = indent line inward (to the left)
    You can use count modified for number of indents - Useful to use visual mode to select your line
Window Splitting : allows you to have multiple windows open on the screen at once 
  'Ctrl' + 'ws' = split horizontally
  'Ctrl' + 'wv' = split vertically
  'Ctrl' + 'wc' = close window
  ':close' = close window
  'Ctrl' + 'w' + <direction> = ('Ctrl' + 'w' + 'h'/'j'/'k'/'l') move to the open buffer window 
Buffers : in the context of vim, it is a temporary memory being utilized for an open file 'buffer stack' only deallocated when you completely close vim
  ':ls' = see a list of all buffers
  ':buffers' = see a list of all buffers
  'buffer <#>' = make the buffer at the designated number(or specifying the filename) the active buffer
  ':bnext' = get next buffer
  ':bprev' = get previous buffer
  ':bfirst' = get first buffer
  ':blast' = get last buffer
  'bufdo %s/hello/goodbye/g | update' = run command for all buffers - will substitute 'hello' for 'goodbye' in every file in the buffer stack
Mark : 
  'm' + <letter> = Mark a spot
  ''' + <letter> = single quotation mark + <letter> will jump to the same line
  '~' + <letter> = Will jump to the exact marked letter/character 

Vim Modes : 
  Normal Mode = Default Mode, you can always return to default mode by pressing 'esc', 
  Command Line Mode : 
    ':' any time you type a colon it will be followed by a command
    '/' = Search forwards, will search the rest of your code
    '?' = Search Backwards, will search previous code for what follows '?'
  Insert Mode :
    'i' = will insert at cursor
    'I' = will insert at start of line
    'a' = insert at after current character
    'A' = Insert at end of Line
    'o' = open below
    'O' = Open above
    'c' = change*
    'C' = change at end of the line
    'c' + 'w' = change word
  Visual Mode : 'V' has two modes, visual line mode and visual mode
    'V' = Visual Mode
    'V' = Visual Line Mode
    'Ctrl' + 'V' = Visual Block Mode - A way of selecting text and doing something with that text
  Replace Mode : 
    'r' = replace a character(exits mode immediately)
    'R' = Replace mode, but will stay in it as you replace multiple characters

File Commands : Most file commands are entered via the command line and start with ':'
  ':w' = write file(save) 
  ':w <filename>' = write file at this <filename> path (save new file)
  ':w!' = attempt to force the file to save(useful for read-only files)
  ':wa' = save all files
  ':q' = quit
  ':q!' = quit force - quit without saving changes
  'qa' = quit all open files
  'Z' = quit(can be used without colon or command line mode)


Switching Tabs(useful for VS code extension/vimium for chromium/neovim and vim)
  'g' + 't' = move forward 1 tab
  'g' + 'T' = move backwards 1 tab
    If you have a lot of tabs open and want to switch between them quickly, you can use the gt and gT commands. 
    The gt command will move the cursor to the next tab in the list, while the gT command will move the cursor to the previous tab.
    You can also use a number before the gt or gT command to move to a specific tab. For example, 2gt will move the cursor to the second tab in the list.
  'x' = Will close current tab
  'Shift' + 'Z' (x2) = Tap Twice, will close current tab in vscode (x doesn't work in VSCode)
  ':tabnext'To switch to the next tab in Vim, press the :tabnext command. This will move the cursor to the next tab in the list.
  ':tabn <number>' If you want to switch to a specific tab, you can press :tabn [number], where [number] is the number of the tab you want to switch to. 
    For example, you would press :tabn 3 to switch to the third tab.
  ':tabmove' = Another way to switch tabs in Vim is to use the :tabmove command. This command allows you to move a tab to a different position in the tab list. 
    For example, to move the current tab to the third position, you would press :tabmove 3.
  'Ctrl' + 'e' = in VSCode, this will allow you to search files in your project directory, very quick if you know what to look for (or 'ctrl' + 'p' OR 'ctrl' + 'shift' + F)
