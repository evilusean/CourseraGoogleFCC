Why to use VIM? : Greater Output and Focus / Less Movement to accomplish task - every time you move the mouse, you lose focus and time / On every linux machine by default /
  Some programs like the 'man' command will use vi-style commands for navigation - sometimes you need to use vim - knowing the basic commands is useful for future sean
Learning Expectations + Goals : 
  1) Understand the History and evolution of vim : This will explain the origin of syntax and commands - Why does this command exist? history explains present - will help you remember
  2) see how powerful and portable VIM can be : if you adopt it as a primary editor - risk wrist Vs Carpal tunnel, programming is notoriously hard on wrists, less movement = less dmg
  3) Fluency in the core VIM commands for everyday scenarios for development or DevOps
Do people hate VIM? : Skill Issue, It's not that hard. Build muscle memory. "People fear what they don't understand and hate what they can't conquer" 
PDP-7 = Programmed Data Processor-7 = Created in 1964, a micro-computer created by big DEC(Digital Equipment Corporation) - had no OS, only tools
11:03 - Unix : 1969 UNIplexed Information Computing System(UNIX) - written in C(created by Dennis Ritchie)- created by Bell Labs in 1969 - Bell Labs = Subsidiary of AT&T
14:30 - Unix Emulated : 1972 - No VI/VIM yet-
19:40 - What is Ed? : 1963 Ed is a text editor built for UNIX OS = 'Ed'itor - line oriented text editor, hard to use because you could not visually see editing in your text file(no terminal back then)
  Teletype Machines = like a typewriter, where you enter the input and the output would print out on paper 'Print' command would literally print on paper
  Almost any edition of UNIX will always have 'Ed' - single letters for input commands 'a' = input mode(append) '.' = while in input mode, the period would commit entries
  '1,$p' #enter command mode, and print, '1' = first line ',' = range operator '$' =regex for last line 'p' for print 
  'wq <filename.txt>' #would write and quit filename, this is where vim got :wq
  'ed hello.txt' #to enter a text file
33:30 - What is EX? :
