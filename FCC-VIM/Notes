Why to use VIM? : Greater Output and Focus / Less Movement to accomplish task - every time you move the mouse, you lose focus and time / On every linux machine by default /
  Some programs like the 'man' command will use vi-style commands for navigation - sometimes you need to use vim - knowing the basic commands is useful for future sean
Learning Expectations + Goals : 
  1) Understand the History and evolution of vim : This will explain the origin of syntax and commands - Why does this command exist? history explains present - will help you remember
  2) see how powerful and portable VIM can be : if you adopt it as a primary editor - risk wrist Vs Carpal tunnel, programming is notoriously hard on wrists, less movement = less dmg
  3) Fluency in the core VIM commands for everyday scenarios for development or DevOps
Do people hate VIM? : Skill Issue, It's not that hard. Build muscle memory. "People fear what they don't understand and hate what they can't conquer"
