Why to use VIM? : Greater Output and Focus / Less Movement to accomplish task - every time you move the mouse, you lose focus and time / On every linux machine by default /
  Some programs like the 'man' command will use vi-style commands for navigation - sometimes you need to use vim - knowing the basic commands is useful for future sean
Learning Expectations + Goals : 
  1) Understand the History and evolution of vim : This will explain the origin of syntax and commands - Why does this command exist? history explains present - will help you remember
  2) see how powerful and portable VIM can be : if you adopt it as a primary editor - risk wrist Vs Carpal tunnel, programming is notoriously hard on wrists, less movement = less dmg
  3) Fluency in the core VIM commands for everyday scenarios for development or DevOps
Do people hate VIM? : Skill Issue, It's not that hard. Build muscle memory. "People fear what they don't understand and hate what they can't conquer" 
PDP-7 = Programmed Data Processor-7 = Created in 1964, a micro-computer created by big DEC(Digital Equipment Corporation) - had no OS, only tools
11:03 - Unix : 1969 UNIplexed Information Computing System(UNIX) - written in C(created by Dennis Ritchie)- created by Bell Labs in 1969 - Bell Labs = Subsidiary of AT&T
14:30 - Unix Emulated : 1972 - No VI/VIM yet-
19:40 - What is Ed? : 1963 Ed is a text editor built for UNIX OS = 'Ed'itor - line oriented text editor, hard to use because you could not visually see editing in your text file(no terminal back then)
  Teletype Machines = like a typewriter, where you enter the input and the output would print out on paper 'Print' command would literally print on paper
  Almost any edition of UNIX will always have 'Ed' - single letters for input commands 'a' = input mode(append) '.' = while in input mode, the period would commit entries
  '1,$p' #enter command mode, and print, '1' = first line ',' = range operator '$' =regex for last line 'p' for print 
  'wq <filename.txt>' #would write and quit filename, this is where vim got :wq
  'ed hello.txt' #to enter a text file
33:30 - What is EX? : 1976 'EX'tended = a line oriented editor created in 1976 that improved the feature set of 'Ed'
  More extensive Commands, history, and undo, multi buffer support, visual mode
  'Em' = A better version of 'Ed' created by George Couloris that could take advantage of video displays, Billy Joel added it to the BSD(Berkley Software Distribution v1.1) in 1978
  ':' = Ex syntax starts to use the ':' colon to declare commands, 'command mode' 
  ':vi' # Visual Mode, added in that allowed users to see the document while they entered commands - no longer needed to enter in line by line
FreeBSD = Software that is still around today, non-copyleft license, powers MacOS, can be commercialized. just watched a video on this yesterday : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKHzcXwTdB4
https://www.freebsd.org/
  Starts looking like 'VIM' to get back to command mode, type ':'
  'k' goes up
  'j' goes down
  'i' goes to insert mode 'esc' back to normal mode
50:00 - What is VI? Vi is a text editor built for the UNIX OS, when BSD 2.0 was being released 'Ex' was renamed to 'Vi' - Visual mode was now just the default mode
  Vi at the time was not considered a lightweight, small portable editor, barely being able to fit into the memory of a PDP-11 or PDP-7
1:10:00 - Finally figures out how to install - <Time Wasted> * <Users Watched> = <Amount of time wasted>. It's just disrespectful, thousands, potentially millions of hours wasted.
Tut - Spent 20 minutes installing vi, why do none of these dudes know how to edit? It only took 2 VM's and 2 OS'. 20 minutes to show 'h' go left 'l' go right.. I feel cheated
1:12:00 - What is Vim? : 1991 - Written by Bram Moolenaar a clone of VI - Stands for 'VI(Improved)' that greatly improved the programs functionality
  Added in syntax highlighting, plugin support, multi level undos, multiple new modes, enhanced search and replace, split windows and tabs, command line history, autocompletion, and more.
  Vim is often set as the default editor in many OS, "How do I exit vim? 'esc' ':q!'"
  Vim has a built in tutorial for beginners called 'vimtutor' which is usually installed along with vim, but is a seperate executable, can be run with a shell command
1:13:45 - VimTutor Vim Help : Read through it, tells you how to use vim, lots of reading
  ':help' easier way to learn vim commands - the docs 
1:22:35 - VimScript : A scripting language, Used to write vim configuration files, plugins and input when in command mode (Neovim uses LUA)
1:23:30 - Vim Configuration Files : Vim has 2 config files, both stored on '/home' directory called '.vimrc' and 'gvimrc'
  '.vimrc' = used for configuring vim
  '.gvimrc' = used for configuring graphical version of GVim or MacVim
  'i' = insert mode when in vim, 
  'esc' ':' + w + q = write and quit
1:33:25 - Vim Plugin Managers : Vim-plug / Pathogen /Vundle / Dien.vim / Neobundle / Volt
  Vim has not conformed to a single plugin manager and there may be plugins that only work with specific plug in manager
  Since Vim 8 you can just git clone to the correct directory for plugins
  Vimball is a self extracting archive format to install plugins and scripts
1:35:00 - What is Janus? : A distribution of plug ins and mappings for vim to quickly configure vim to provide a modern experience (NeoVimChad for non-chads)
  https://github.com/carlhuda/janus
1:48:10 - Install A plugin with Vim Plug :
  https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
    Follow the instructions from repo above and edit the 'vimrc' file, specify which plugins you want, then run ':PlugInstall()' in vim

2:07:00 - What is NeoVim? : 2014 A clone of VIM rewritten from the ground up to be hyperextensible (not by bram, for by bram, about bram) - works in LUA
2:13:10 - Vimium :
