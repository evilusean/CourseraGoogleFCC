The current names in the guests.txt file should be: Bob, Andrea, Manuel, Polly, Khalid, Sam, Danielle and Jacob.

Was the guests.txt file correctly appended with the new guests? If not, go back and edit your code making sure to fill in the gaps appropriately so that the new guests are correctly added to the guests.txt file. Once the new guests are successfully added, you have filled in the missing code correctly. Great!

Now let's remove the guests that have checked out already. There are several ways to do this, however, the method we will choose for this exercise is outlined as follows:

Open the file in "read" mode.
Iterate over each line in the file and put each guest's name into a Python list.
Open the file once again in "write" mode.
Add each guest's name in the Python list to the file one by one.

Ready? Fill in the missing code in the following cell to remove the guests that have checked out already.

checked_out=["Andrea", "Manuel", "Khalid"]
temp_list=[]

with open("guests.txt", "r") as guests:
    for g in guests:
        temp_list.append(g.strip())

with open("guests.txt", "w") as guests:
    for name in temp_list:
        if name not in checked_out:
            guests.write(name + "\n")
            
 #To check whether your code correctly removed the checked out guests from the guests.txt file, run the following cell.

Once the checked out guests are successfully removed, you have filled in the missing code correctly. Awesome!

Now let's check whether Bob and Andrea are still checked in. How could we do this? We'll just read through each line in the file to see if their name is in there. Run the following code to check whether Bob and Andrea are still checked in.

        else:
            print("{} is not checked in".format(check))
# We can see that Bob is checked in while Andrea is not. Nice work! You've learned the basics of reading and writing files in Python!
