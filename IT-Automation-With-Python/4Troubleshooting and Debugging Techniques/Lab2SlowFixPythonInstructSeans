Introduction
You're an IT administrator for a media production company that uses Network-Attached Storage (NAS) to store all data generated daily (e.g., videos, photos). One of your daily tasks is to back up the data in the production NAS (mounted at /data/prod on the server) to the backup NAS (mounted at /data/prod_backup on the server). A former member of the team developed a Python script (full path /scripts/dailysync.py) that backs up data daily. But recently, there's been a lot of data generated and the script isn't catching up to the speed. As a result, the backup process now takes more than 20 hours to finish, which isn't efficient at all for a daily backup.

What you'll do
Identify what limits the system performance: I/O, Network, CPU, or Memory
Use rsync command instead of cp to transfer data
Get system standard output and manipulate the output
Find differences between threading and multiprocessing

CPU bound
CPU bound means the program is bottlenecked by the CPU (Central Processing Unit). When your program is waiting for I/O (e.g., disk read/write, network read/write), the CPU is free to do other tasks, even if your program is stopped. The speed of your program will mostly depend on how fast that I/O can happen; if you want to speed it up, you'll need to speed up the I/O. If your program is running lots of program instructions and not waiting for I/O, then it's CPU bound. Speeding up the CPU will make the program run faster.

In either case, the key to speeding up the program might not be to speed up the hardware but to optimize the program to reduce the amount of I/O or CPU it needs. Or you can have it do I/O while it also does CPU-intensive work. CPU bound implies that upgrading the CPU or optimizing code will improve the overall computing performance.

In order to check how much your program utilizes CPU, you first need to install the pip3 which is a Python package installer. This downloads and configures new Python modules with single-line commands. For any pop-up messages, when the prompt Do you want to continue appears, type ‘Y'.

sudo apt install python3-pip
Copied!
psutil (process and system utilities) is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python. It's mainly useful for system monitoring, profiling, and limiting process resources and management of running processes. Install the psutil python library using pip3:

pip3 install psutil
Copied!
Now open python3 interpreter.

python3
Copied!
Import psutil python3 module for checking CPU usage as well as the I/O and network bandwidth.

import psutil
psutil.cpu_percent()
Copied!
Output:

This shows that CPU utilization is low. Here, you have a CPU with multiple cores; this means one fully loaded CPU thread/virtual core equals 1.2% of total load. So, it only uses one core of the CPU regardless of having multiple cores.

After checking CPU utilization, you noticed that they're not reaching the limit.

So, you check the CPU usage, and it looks like the script only uses a single core to run. But your server has a bunch of cores, which means the task is CPU-bound.

Now, using psutil.disk_io_counters() and psutil.net_io_counters() you'll get byte read and byte write for disk I/O and byte received and byte sent for the network I/O bandwidth. For checking disk I/O, you can use the following command:

psutil.disk_io_counters()
Copied!
Output:

bf5be131f213b8b7.png

For checking the network I/O bandwidth:

psutil.net_io_counters()
Copied!
Output:

ffc3ad94f060bcaf.png

Exit from the Python shell using exit().

After checking the disk I/O and network bandwidth, you noticed the amount of byte read and byte write for disk I/O and byte received and byte sent for the network I/O bandwidth.

Basics rsync command
rsync(remote sync) is a utility for efficiently transferring and synchronizing files between a computer and an external hard drive and across networked computers by comparing the modification time and size of files. One of the important features of rsync is that it works on the delta transfer algorithm, which means it'll only sync or copy the changes from the source to the destination instead of copying the whole file. This ultimately reduces the amount of data sent over the network.

The basic syntax of the rsync command is below:

rsync [Options] [Source-Files-Dir] [Destination]
Copied!
Some of the commonly used options in rsync command are listed below:

Options

Uses

-v

Verbose output

-q

Suppress message output

-a

Archive files and directory while synchronizing

-r

Sync files and directories recursively

-b

Take the backup during synchronization

-z

Compress file data during the transfer

Example:

Copy or sync files locally:

rsync -zvh [Source-Files-Dir] [Destination]
Copied!
Copy or sync directory locally:

rsync -zavh [Source-Files-Dir] [Destination]
Copied!
Copy files and directories recursively locally:

rsync -zrvh [Source-Files-Dir] [Destination]
Copied!

Example:
In order to use the rsync command in Python, use the subprocess module by calling call methods and passing a list as an argument. You can do this by opening the python3 shell:

python3
Copied!
Now, import the subprocess module and call the call method and pass the arguments:

import subprocess
src = "<source-path>" # replace <source-path> with the source directory
dest = "<destination-path>" # replace <destination-path> with the destination directory
Copied!
subprocess.call(["rsync", "-arq", src, dest])
Copied!
By using the above script, you can sync your data recursively from the source path to the destination path.

Exit from the Python shell using exit().

Multiprocessing
Now, when you go through the hierarchy of the subfolders of /data/prod, data is from different projects (e.g., , beta, gamma, kappa) and they're independent of each other. So, in order to efficiently back up parallelly, use multiprocessing to take advantage of the idle CPU cores. Initially, because of CPU bound, the backup process takes more than 20 hours to finish, which isn't efficient for a daily backup. Now, by using multiprocessing, you can back up your data from the source to the destination parallelly by utilizing the multiple cores of the CPU.

User practice
Navigate to the script/ directory using the command below:

ls ~/scripts
Copied!
Output:

593374f1637cec93.png

Now, you'll get the Python script multisync.py for practice in order to understand how multiprocessing works. We used the Pool class of the multiprocessing Python module. Here, we define a run method to perform the tasks. Next, we have a few tasks. Create a pool object of the Pool class of a specific number of CPUs your system has by passing a number of tasks you have. Start each task within the pool object by calling the map instance method, and pass the run function and the list of tasks as an argument.

Now, grant executable permission to the multisync.py Python script for running this file.

sudo chmod +x ~/scripts/multisync.py
Copied!
Run the multisync.py Python script:

./scripts/multisync.py
Copied!
Output:

User exercise
Now that you understand how multiprocessing works, let's fix CPU bound so that it doesn't take more than 20 hours to finish. Try applying multiprocessing, which takes advantage of the idle CPU cores for parallel processing.

Open the dailysync.py Python script in the nano editor that needs to be modified. It's similar to multisync.py that utilizes idle CPU cores for the backup.

nano ~/scripts/dailysync.py
Copied!
Here, you have to use multiprocessing and subprocess module methods to sync the data from /data/prod to /data/prod_backup folder.

Hint: os.walk() generates the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up. This is used to traverse the file system in Python.
Once you're done writing the Python script, save the file by clicking Ctrl-o, the Enter key, and Ctrl-x.

Now, grant the executable permission to the dailysync.py Python script for running this file.

sudo chmod +x ~/scripts/dailysync.py
Copied!
Run the dailysync.py Python script:

./scripts/dailysync.py
Copied!
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.
Backup from production to production backup server

Congratulations!
You've successfully synced or copied data from different multimedia projects from the source location to the destination using rsync command used in the Python script. And you've reduced the backup time by taking advantage of the idle CPU cores for parallel processing using multiprocessing. Backing up a large amount of data from one place to another place will definitely help you in the field of IT.
