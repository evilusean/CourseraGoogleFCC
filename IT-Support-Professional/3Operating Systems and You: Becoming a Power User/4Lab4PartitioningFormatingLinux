Partitioning and Formatting a Disk Drive in Linux

Introduction
In this lab, you'll learn how to partition and format a disk drive in Linux. Knowing how to do this is a critical skill to have as an IT Support Specialist. Partitions are important because a file system can't function without one. When you acquire a new disk drive, at least one partition is required in order to be able to write files to the file system. Different partitions can then have different file formats, depending on their purpose. For example, a disk partition that acts as a swap for your main memory may have a different file format than the default user-facing file systems. Partitions, like those used for system recovery, may also have different file formats. This shows you just how important this skill is to every IT Support Specialist out there.

Head's up: You'll experience a delay as the labs initially load (particularly for Windows labs). So, please wait a couple of minutes for the labs to load. The grade is calculated when the lab is complete, so be sure to hit End Lab when you're done!

You'll have 60 minutes to complete this lab.

What you'll do
You'll learn how to partition a disk drive into one or more partitions. You'll also learn how to format each of those partitions to a different file format. Your main learning objective for this lab is to practice the partitioning and formatting commands you'll find in this lab in the Linux VM.

Learning tip:
We encourage you to try and memorize all of these commands as best you can. With enough practice, using Linux commands will become second-nature to you. If you have access to your own Linux machine, try out the commands as you follow along in the next section.

If you don't have Linux available on your local machine, no worries! You can type these commands in a text editor, so you can refer back to them when you're doing the active lab exercises.

Blocks and partitions
Before diving into the details of creating partitions and formatting them, let's kick things off with a review of blocks and partitions.

Blocks
Blocks are a layer of storage devices that allow individual access to each independently. They allow programs to access storage without worrying about whether the underlying hardware device is a hard drive, solid state drive, flash drive, etc.

In Linux, you can view block devices and file systems attached to your system using the lsblk command. This command gathers information about all devices attached to the system, and prints them out using a tree-like structure. To view the devices attached to your VM, use the lsblk command.

lsblk

You'll see that your instance has two block devices (sda or sdb) attached to it (disks). Each of them is 10GB in size. The column MOUNTPOINT shows where a block device is mounted. It’s a location of files on the disk, where files can be accessed by the Linux file system. In this case, the MOUNTPOINT (/etc/hosts) is displayed against sdb, which means the second disk (sdb) is mounted at the root of the Linux file system tree. Thus, the files you're seeing on your system right now are from this disk.

A first disk, sda, is also available, but it's not mounted (UNMOUNT). In this lab, you'll divide this disk into two partitions. You'll mount one of these partitions onto the file system, so you can start accessing files from it.

Note: These may be swapped for you, and your VM may be mounted on sda instead of sdb. This will change the commands used in the lab, so when you see \[MOUNT DRIVE\] replace it with your mount drive (sda or sdb) i.e the one which is displaying against /etc/hosts and when you see \[UNMOUNTED DRIVE\] replace it with the other one. If your VM is mounted on sda, the screenshots will also be flipped from what you will see based on the disk on which your VM is mounted on.
Optionally, you can view disks mounted on the system using the df command. This command is normally used to display the amount of space available on the file system. It lists all block devices with the available space on them. Use the -h option to display file sizes in human readable format.

df -h

Partitions
Instead of using a storage block as a whole, it's common practice to divide a storage block into different partitions. Partitions can be different sizes, and formatted to different filesystems. This allows you to use a single storage device for different purposes.

You can display partition information using the fdisk command. You can also use the -l option to list partitions in the block. You can pass a device name to the fdisk command to list the partitions contained in that device.

To list all partitions, use fdisk -l

sudo fdisk -l

Partition table entries are not in disk order.
fdisk displays information contained in the partition table, where information about partitions is stored.

Disk partitioning with fdisk
When the fdisk command is used without options, it provides a menu-driven environment for creating and deleting partitions.

Caution!: Modifying partitions is destructive, and can lead to loss of data. Not good! Remember to always backup your data before modifying partitions on a live system.
Mount and umount
Mounting and unmounting mean making devices available or unavailable on a Linux file system. This is accomplished by the commands mount and umount. Before modifying a disk, you should first unmount it from the system, using the umount command. When modifications on the disk are done, you should mount it back onto the system. For this exercise, since the device we're partitioning isn't initially mounted, you can proceed with partitioning.

Go ahead and start fdisk in interactive mode by passing the name of the disk you want to partition. In this lab, we'll partition /dev/sda as it's unmounted drive.

Note: In this lab, we will partition the disk that's not currently mounted. You should select dev/[UNMOUNTED DRIVE] for creating a partition. You can still partition the disk even when the operating system is running from it, but a reboot will be required in order for the partition changes you make to take place.
Start fdisk by passing the disk you want to partition as the parameter.

sudo fdisk /dev/[UNMOUNTED DRIVE]

Command (m for help): 
To create a new partition, the command control n is used. However, since all the space on the disk is currently allocated, you'll need to first free up space by deleting the default partitions.

Use the d command control to delete the default partitions. When you issue the d command control, fdisk asks you to enter the number of partitions you want to delete. Since you have twelve partitions, fdisk automatically selects the last partition by default, and pressing Enter deletes the last partition. Repeat this process until you delete all the twelve partitions.

Provide the last sector of the new partition, up to where you want to allocate. The difference between the first and last sectors makes up the total size of the partition. Disk sector represents units used to measure the size on disks. Each sector stores a fixed amount of data. In lots of hard disks, for example, a sector stores 512 bytes. To create the first 1GB partition, enter 2097200 (divide the original partition by 10).

Changed type of partition 'Linux filesystem' to 'Linux swap'.
Command (m for help): 
The partition type will be changed to match the selection.

Up to this point, you've just been editing the partition table in memory. You can use the q command here to quit fdisk without committing changes to the disk. You can also update your partitions by using the d and n commands to remove and add new partitions.

You can also use the v command here to verify your changes before proceeding.

Command (m for help): v
No errors detected.
Header version: 1.0
Using 2 out of 128 partitions.
A total of 4013 free sectors is available in 2 segments (the largest is 1007 KiB).
If you're satisfied with the changes you've made so far, you can commit them to the disk by using the w command.

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered.
Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.

Partitioning

Formatting partitions using mkfs
Next, you'll create different file systems in the partitions you just created. You'll do this by using the command mkfs in Linux. Multiple filesystem types exist, and it's important to know all of them, along with the functions they're best suited for. In this lab, you'll format the second partition into ext4, the most widely used Linux filesystem type.

To do this, use lsblk again to find the disk you want to create the file system type in.
