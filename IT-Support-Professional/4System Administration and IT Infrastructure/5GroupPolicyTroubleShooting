Group Policy Troubleshooting
This reading expands upon a previous topic on various approaches to troubleshooting common Group Policy problems. 

Terminology
Important terminology used with Microsoft Windows Server Group Policies:

Group Policy Object (GPO): A set of Active Directory (AD) Group Policy configurations that controls the appearance and behaviors for groups of 
  computer systems and/or groups of end users. 
Group Policy Management Console (GPMC): A console that is used to create, manage, edit, and link GPOs. The GPMC provides thousands of options for
  computer and user settings such as Control Panel items, Registry settings, and environmental variables. Policy settings are refreshed every 90 
  minutes, so changes are not applied immediately. The GPMC can be used to create GPOs that control registry-based policies and software
  installations, as well as options for:
  security
  maintenance
  scripts
  folder redirection
  
Active Directory (AD) containers: AD containers can be linked to GPOs. AD containers include:
Sites: Physical sites or aspects of a network, which are linked to AD Domains. Can be used to group and connect geographically dispersed locations
  into the same domain. 
Domain: A collection of objects in an AD network, such as computers, users, and groups. Can contain multiple AD Sites and be linked to multiple
  GPOs. 
Organizational Unit (OU): Collectively groups end users, computers, groups, and/or other OUs. OUs can reflect an organization’s hierarchy
  and business divisions. For example, an organization might have separate OUs for executives, administration, accounting, IT, sales, marketing, 
  vendors, etc. 

GPOs process order: Windows will apply GPOs in the following order:
	1) The Local GPO
	2) GPOs linked to Sites
	3) GPOs linked to Domains
	4) GPOs linked to OUs

Resultant Set of Policies (RSoPs): A report of AD Group Policy settings that indicates how all GPO settings are hierarchically inherited by end 
  users and computers. RSoP reports can be collected for evaluation using RSoPs logging. 
Windows Management Infrastructure (MI) and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI): MI is the next generation of WMI. However, both MI and WMI 
  are fully supported by Microsoft and MI is backwards-compatible with WMI. MI/WMI provide the operations infrastructure and management data 
  in Windows. They also are used for scripting administrative tasks to run on remote systems. 


Group Policy troubleshooting tools :
The following command line tools can be used for troubleshooting Group Policy issues:

gpresult: Displays the RSoP report or values for a computer and user account. This information can help to ascertain which configuration settings
  have been applied and which settings were overridden. A few of the switches available to the gpresult command include:
/s host - Displays the RSoP values of a remote computer.
/u user-account - Displays the RSoP values of an end-user.
/p password - Displays the RSoP values of an end-user password policy.
/r - Displays the RSoP summary of applied GPOs.
/z - Turns on verbose mode to display details of the RSoP applied settings.

gpedit: The Group Policy Editor, which is a robust tool for changing Registry settings related to the Control Panel, Settings, user profiles,
  system configurations, third-party software, and more. 
gpupdate: Command that can be used to force a new or edited GPO to be applied immediately using the /force switch. If the policy setting requires 
  the users to logoff or reboot, the switches /logoff or /boot can be added to the command.

Additionally, system event logs are important tools for most Windows troubleshooting issues:
Event Viewer and Windows Logs: The Windows Event Viewer is an invaluable tool for viewing Windows Logs. These tools help IT Support specialists 
  track system problems and events related to items like applications, user logins, security, and systems. To open the Windows Event Viewer, 
  click on the Start menu and type “Event Viewer”. Any error messages or codes found in the logs can be investigated using the Microsoft Knowledge 
  Base (support.microsoft.com), as well as through an internet search. The main Windows Logs include:
System log: Records Windows OS events like hardware conflicts, driver load failures, service load failures, network issues, and more.
Application log: Records application processes and utilities events/errors.
Security log: Records system security audit information.
Setup log: Records installation events and errors.

Group Policy Troubleshooting Example
As an IT Support professional, you may need to troubleshoot Group Policy issues in Windows. The following are a few examples of the most common
problems encountered when working with Group Policies. Included are suggested tips on how to troubleshoot these issues using tools you’ve learned
about previously. 

Scenario 1: Group Policy settings are not being applied 
Imagine that you are an IT Support Analyst for an organization. You recently made changes to several settings on a Group Policy Object (GPO).
  However, the group policy changes do not appear to be active for the target end users or computers. You must troubleshoot to uncover the root of
  the problem and to fix it. 
Check the GPO Scope. In the Group Policy Management utility, select the GPO that you recently changed and go to the Scope tab. Check the Links 
  section to see if the GPO that you changed is linked to the correct Organizational Units (OUs). The linked OUs should contain the target
  computers (for computer-side settings) or target users (for user-side settings) for the changed GPOs.  
Check Security Filtering. Below the Links section on the Scope tab, check the Security Filtering section. Make sure the correct computers and/or 
  users intended for the changed GPO settings are specified in the security filters. 
Check Read and Apply permissions. If any items have been added to Security Filtering, check the Delegation > Advanced tab to ensure the Allow
  option is checked for the Read and Apply permissions. 
Check the Group Policy Delegation. On the Delegation tab, check the Groups and users section for Allowed Permissions for the GPO. This list 
  contains the groups and users that have the authority to edit, delete, and modify security for the GPO. Ensure that these settings are desired 
  for your environment and no unauthorized users or groups can edit GPO settings. 
Enable/disable User or Computer configurations. On the Details tab of the GPO, check the GPO Status to ensure the selection matches your intended 
  setting. The options are: 
All settings disabled: GPO will be inactive.
Computer configuration settings disabled: Any Computer configurations in the GPO will be inactive.
User configuration settings disabled: Any User configurations in the GPO will be inactive.
Enabled: All GPO configurations will be applied (default).
Check the GPO Policy Process Order (LSDOU). The GPO process order from first applied to last is Local GPOs, Site GPOs, Domain GPOs, then OU GPOs.
  Each GPO policy overrides the previous GPO setting in this LSDOU process order. To change the default order, select the affected OU in the Group
  Policy Manager and go to the Linked Group Policy Objects tab. The Link Order enumeration for the GPOs is listed in reverse order, meaning the
  GPO with the highest Link Order number is applied first and the GPO with the lowest number (1) is applied last. The number 1 indicates the GPO
  has the top-ranking priority, as it will override the previous GPO settings where the settings overlap. You can change the order that the GPOs
  are applied using the up and down arrows to the left of the list.  
Ensure target GPO to OU links are enabled. GPO to OU links are technically shortcuts, which can easily be enabled or disabled. Check to ensure 
  that the Link Enabled setting has not inadvertently been turned off. 
Check if an upstream GPO is set to Enforced. An upstream GPO is a GPO linked to an OU that has a higher LSDOU priority than a downstream GPO.
  If an upstream order of applying settings is enforced, a lock will appear on the link icon. Evaluate if enforcement is overriding the desired
  GPO settings. 
Check if the affected OU is set to Block Inheritance. The default Group Policy inheritance for OUs, which is applied hierarchically to nested 
  objects, can be blocked. Block Inheritance is indicated in the Group Policy Manager as a blue exclamation point icon on the affected OU. If you
  believe this setting might be the cause of the GPO changes not propagating, right-click on the OU and select Block Inheritance from the menu to
  toggle it off/on. Note that Block Inheritance will not affect Enforced GPOs. 
Check if loopback is enabled. If loopback is enabled, the user-side settings that belong to the computer’s OU will override any computer-side 
  settings in the same OU. If the OU’s computer-side settings need to have priority over the user-side, set the user Group Policy loopback 
  processing mode to Disabled. 
Check MI or WMI filters. Check to see if Windows Management Infrastructure (MI) or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) filters are set on the
  changed GPO. MI or WMI filters might be used to apply a policy to a subset of objects. The MI or WMI query may need to be edited to ensure the
  target objects for the changed GPO are not excluded by the filter. 
Ensure your expectations for the GPO setting match its actual purpose. If the troubleshooting steps listed above do not solve the Group Policy
  problem, research the GPO settings you are using. It is possible that your expectation for a setting may not match what the setting actually 
  does.  

Scenario 2: GPO settings are not correct.
Edit incorrect GPO settings. If there are any problems found with GPO settings, open the Group Policy Management interface and edit the GPO:
Step 1: Select the GPO with the incorrect settings.
Step 2: Right-click the GPO, and then click Edit.
Step 3: Edit the settings using the appropriate instructions listed in Scenario 1 of this article.

Scenario 3: The user can’t authenticate into the Active Directory domain 
Check Active Directory (AD) infrastructure. Investigate if the user or computer cannot locate the domain controller. Domain controller and 
  replication problems in AD can prevent GPOs from functioning correctly.
