=======================================================================================================Week 1:
System Administration(SysAdmins)=The field in IT that's responsible for maintaining reliable computer systesms in a multi user environment
  Network Administrators/Database Administrators=As an organization gets bigger, you need teams of sysadmins with different responsibilities
IT Infrastructure=Encompasses the software, hardware, network and services required for an organization to operate in an enterprise IT environment
Servers=Software or a machine that provides services to other software or machines
Servers Can be: PC's, Tower Servers, rack servers, Blade Servers
  Webservers/Email Servers/SSH Servers/etc
Clients=request services from a server
KVM(Keyboard Video Mouse) Switch=Keep on hand in case you can't remotely SSH into a server, allows you to connect multiple servers to one KVM
Data Center=A facility that stores hundreds/thousands of servers
The Cloud Drawbacks=Cost=Instead of having one big upfront cost of buying a server, you pay a subscription for use
  Dependance=You are dependant on third party for maintaining and securing your data

System Administration Tasks:
Policies: Smaller companies, security policies fall under sysadmins, larger companies under CSO(Cheif Security Officer)
  Should users be allowed to install software? Probably not, run risk of normie downloading malicious software
  Should users have complex passwords with certain requirements? good rule of thumb, min 8 characters
  Should users be allowed to use non work related content such as facebook? Depends on organization
  If you hand out a company phone to an employee, should you set a device password? Absolutely
  Documentation of policies? Yes.
Maintain all IT infrastructure for company
Sysadmins must manage users and hardware, create new users and give them access to appropriate resources, remove them if they leave company
Hardware Lifecycle=Procurement > Deployment > Maintenance > Retirement
  New Employee Hired -> Set up User Account -> Find them a computer -> Tag Machine -> Image computer with a base image -> Name Computer(standardiz
  -> Install Software -> Instruct user how to use machine -> If user leaves company, remove user from access
Imaging=Try to automate provisioning a new machine, should take minutes, not hours
Batch Update=Once every month(ish), update all servers with latest security patches, ensure new update works with service
Also need to maintain Printers, Phones, Fax Machines, Video/Conferencing Machines=Can work with vendors to maintain these devices
TroubleShooting:asking questions, isolating the problem, reading logs
  ticketing systems help organize and prioritize issues
Customer Service=Showing empathy, right tone of voice, dealing well with difficult situations
Avoid Using Administrator rights for tasks that don't require them; respect the privacy of others, don't read others emails,
Document what you do, using 'script' cmdlet in linux or 'Start-Transcript' in windows
Make a copy of the state before changing it, or using a version control system to avoid making terrible decisions
Rollback=Reverting to a previous state
Production=The parts of the infrastructure where a certain service is executed and served to its users
Test Environment=A virtual machine running the same configuration as the production environment, but isn't actually serving any of the users
Secondary/Standby Machine=Will be exactly the same as the production machine, but won't receive any traffic from actual users until you enable it
Always test before deploying, the more users your service reaches, the more you'll want to ensure the changes aren't disruptive
Reproduction Case=Before you start fixing it, make sure you can recreate the error to ensure you have it fixed. x3 questions=
  What steps did you take to get to this point?
  What's the unexpected or bad result?
  What's the expected result?

=======================================================================================================Week 2:
IT Infrastructure Services:
IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service):give you preconfigured Virtual Machines
NaaS(Networking as a Service:third party networks/security
SaaS(Software as a Service):software licenses you can purchase

NTP(Network Time Protocol)=Used to keep machines clocks synchronized when connected to a network
Local NTP Server=Inhouse Vs Public NTP server=Other organizations that manage NTP servers that you can sync client machines to get synchronized
Intranet=An internal network inside a company; accessible if you're on a companies network
Proxy Server=Acts as anintermediary between a companie's network and the internet, provides privacy and security, and regulates access
DNS(Domain Name System)=Maps human understandable names to an IP address
Hostfiles=Allow you to map static IP addresses to HostName Mappings, compputers will first check hostfile then DNS servers
  /etc/hosts #linux hostfile
  127.0.0.1 #references back to the computer(self)
DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuartion Procol)=Static IP address Vs DHCP assigned address from server
  DHCP Server=Is set up to a machine with a static IP address configured to the network interface to serve the DHCP queries, linked to the physical
  network with any number of machines on it
Unable to resolve a hostname or domain name:
  First check your connection is actually working/ping www.google.com
  nslookup #name server for a host or domain name, copy IP address and paste in web browser
  /etc/hosts #where DNS is stored in linux check here before an authoritative server, change entry to www.google.com 

Managing System Services:
Daemons=Background Processes=Services=the program doesn't need to interact with a user through the graphical interface or the command line 
  interface to provide the neccesary service
Configuration Files=Each service has one or more configuration files, that determine how you want the service to behave
Services are usually configured to start when the machine boots, or crashes, this can be changed
Configuring Services in Windows:
Start -> Control Panel -> Turn Windows Features on and off -> Server Manager -> Enable Internet Information Services -> Add Features

Configuring Network Services:
DNSMasq=A program that provides DNS, DHCP, TFTP and PXE services in a simple package
  dig www.example.com @localhost #DNS lookup, checking the localhost, if none found checks DNS servers
DHCP with DNSMasq:
  ip address show eth_srv #shows IP address for eth_srv
  ip address show eth_cli #shows IP address for eth_cli
  cat dhcp.conf #shows a file with 'interface=eth_srv' which configures for listening for DHCP queries from eth_srv
  sudo dnsmasq -d -q -C dhcp.conf #tells dnsmasq to start listening for queries using this config

=======================================================================================================Week 3:

Licensing=When someone leaves the company, you can reuse their license, make sure to check terms and agreements
File Services=Centrally store files and manage access and groups
NFS(Network File System)=A protocol that enables files to be shared over a network, compatible with all OS's Vs Samba(Windows)
  Requires you to set up a NFS server(linux environment pref), modify config files for directories you want shared access to, mount filesystem(host
NAS(Network Attached Storage)=Computers that are optimized for file storage
Mobile Synchronization=Make sure data is the same in 2 or more places, if you lose device - you'll still have data
Printing Services:
When managing Printer IT infrastructure, you need to have a place to centrally manage all your printers(Print Server)
  +diagnostic information(low toner levels)+Printer Drivers Deployment
  To set up a print server, all you have to do is install a print service on a server
CUPS(Common Unix Printer System)=Linux preinstalled print service commonly preinstalled on linux systems
When print service is set up, you need to add printer to client machine
Platform Services:
Webservers=Stores and serves content through the internet
  Apache=most popular webserver, free and opensource

TroubleShooting Platform Services:
HTTP Status Codes=codes or numbers that indicate sine sirt if error or info messages that occured when trying to access a web resource
  404 Not Found=Indicates that the URL you entered doesn't point to anything
  4xx Client Side Issue=HTTP status codes that start with 4xx indicate an issue on the client side
  5xx Server Side Issue=HTTP status codes that start with 5xx indicate an issue on the server side
  2xx Succces=Request is successful, codes that begin with 2xx denote Success!
Google Chrome F12(Ctrl+Shift+I):Opens developer tools
Cloud Concepts:
SaaS(Software as a Service)=The Software is already preconfigured and the user isn't deeply involved in the cloud configuration
IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service)=You're hosting your own services in the cloud. You need to decide how you want the infrastructure to look,
  depending on how you want to run it
Regions=A geographical location containing a number of data centers, when setting up a cloud service you need to consider regions(Zone)
  If a zone fails for some reason, tbe others are still available and services can be migrated without visibily affecting users
Public Cloud=Cloud services provided to you by a third party
Private Cloud=When your company owns the services and the rest of your infrastructure - whether onsite or remote data center
Hybrid Cloud=A mixture of both public and private cloud
Load balancer=Ensures that each VM(virtual machine) receives a balanced number of queries
Autoscaling=It allowsthe service to increase or reduce capacity as needed, while the service owner only pays for the cost of the machines that are
  in use at any given time, you can set up monitoring and alerting to detect and correct any problems that need correcting

=======================================================================================================Week 4:
Directory Services:
Useful for organizaing data and making it searchable for an organization
Directory Server=Contains a lookup service that provides mapping between network resources and their network addresses
  Instead of storing User accounts locally on every machine, all that information can be stored on a directory server
Replication=The stored directory data can be copied and distributed across a number of physically distributed servers, but still appear as one
  unified datastore for querying and administrating
OU's(Organizational Units)=Containers=Can contain objects or more OU's, OU's are like folders and can contain files, folders and objects

Centralized Management:
A central service that provides instructtions to all of the different parts of my IT infrastructure
AAA(Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)=Directory Services provide centralized AAA
RBAC(Role Based Access Control)=Use users groups to grant access to resources instead of individually granting access
Configuration Management=By centralizing the configuration management of your computers/software you can save time using logon scripts, etc
  Chef Vs Puppet Vs SCCM=Configuration Management Tools
LDAP(Lightweight Directory Acces Protocol):
Used to access information in directory services like over a network
LDAP Entry Format/Notation= dn:CN=Sean Teams,OU=Sysadmin,DC=example,DC=com
