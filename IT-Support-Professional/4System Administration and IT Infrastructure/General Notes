=======================================================================================================Week 1:
System Administration(SysAdmins)=The field in IT that's responsible for maintaining reliable computer systesms in a multi user environment
  Network Administrators/Database Administrators=As an organization gets bigger, you need teams of sysadmins with different responsibilities
IT Infrastructure=Encompasses the software, hardware, network and services required for an organization to operate in an enterprise IT environment
Servers=Software or a machine that provides services to other software or machines
Servers Can be: PC's, Tower Servers, rack servers, Blade Servers
  Webservers/Email Servers/SSH Servers/etc
Clients=request services from a server
KVM(Keyboard Video Mouse) Switch=Keep on hand in case you can't remotely SSH into a server, allows you to connect multiple servers to one KVM
Data Center=A facility that stores hundreds/thousands of servers
The Cloud Drawbacks=Cost=Instead of having one big upfront cost of buying a server, you pay a subscription for use
  Dependance=You are dependant on third party for maintaining and securing your data

System Administration Tasks:
Policies: Smaller companies, security policies fall under sysadmins, larger companies under CSO(Cheif Security Officer)
  Should users be allowed to install software? Probably not, run risk of normie downloading malicious software
  Should users have complex passwords with certain requirements? good rule of thumb, min 8 characters
  Should users be allowed to use non work related content such as facebook? Depends on organization
  If you hand out a company phone to an employee, should you set a device password? Absolutely
  Documentation of policies? Yes.
Maintain all IT infrastructure for company
Sysadmins must manage users and hardware, create new users and give them access to appropriate resources, remove them if they leave company
Hardware Lifecycle=Procurement > Deployment > Maintenance > Retirement
  New Employee Hired -> Set up User Account -> Find them a computer -> Tag Machine -> Image computer with a base image -> Name Computer(standardiz
  -> Install Software -> Instruct user how to use machine -> If user leaves company, remove user from access
Imaging=Try to automate provisioning a new machine, should take minutes, not hours
Batch Update=Once every month(ish), update all servers with latest security patches, ensure new update works with service
Also need to maintain Printers, Phones, Fax Machines, Video/Conferencing Machines=Can work with vendors to maintain these devices
TroubleShooting:asking questions, isolating the problem, reading logs
  ticketing systems help organize and prioritize issues
Customer Service=Showing empathy, right tone of voice, dealing well with difficult situations
Avoid Using Administrator rights for tasks that don't require them; respect the privacy of others, don't read others emails,
Document what you do, using 'script' cmdlet in linux or 'Start-Transcript' in windows
Make a copy of the state before changing it, or using a version control system to avoid making terrible decisions
Rollback=Reverting to a previous state
Production=The parts of the infrastructure where a certain service is executed and served to its users
Test Environment=A virtual machine running the same configuration as the production environment, but isn't actually serving any of the users
Secondary/Standby Machine=Will be exactly the same as the production machine, but won't receive any traffic from actual users until you enable it
Always test before deploying, the more users your service reaches, the more you'll want to ensure the changes aren't disruptive
Reproduction Case=Before you start fixing it, make sure you can recreate the error to ensure you have it fixed. x3 questions=
  What steps did you take to get to this point?
  What's the unexpected or bad result?
  What's the expected result?
