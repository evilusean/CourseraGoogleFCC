System Administration(SysAdmins)=The field in IT that's responsible for maintaining reliable computer systesms in a multi user environment
  Network Administrators/Database Administrators=As an organization gets bigger, you need teams of sysadmins with different responsibilities
IT Infrastructure=Encompasses the software, hardware, network and services required for an organization to operate in an enterprise IT environment
Servers=Software or a machine that provides services to other software or machines
Servers Can be: PC's, Tower Servers, rack servers, Blade Servers
  Webservers/Email Servers/SSH Servers/etc
Clients=request services from a server
KVM(Keyboard Video Mouse) Switch=Keep on hand in case you can't remotely SSH into a server, allows you to connect multiple servers to one KVM
Data Center=A facility that stores hundreds/thousands of servers
The Cloud Drawbacks=Cost=Instead of having one big upfront cost of buying a server, you pay a subscription for use
  Dependance=You are dependant on third party for maintaining and securing your data

System Administration Tasks:
Policies: Smaller companies, security policies fall under sysadmins, larger companies under CSO(Cheif Security Officer)
  Should users be allowed to install software? Probably not, run risk of normie downloading malicious software
  Should users have complex passwords with certain requirements? good rule of thumb, min 8 characters
  Should users be allowed to use non work related content such as facebook? Depends on organization
  If you hand out a company phone to an employee, should you set a device password? Absolutely
  Documentation of policies? Yes.
Maintain all IT infrastructure for company
Sysadmins must manage users and hardware, create new users and give them access to appropriate resources, remove them if they leave company
Hardware Lifecycle=Procurement > Deployment > Maintenance > Retirement
  New Employee Hired -> Set up User Account -> Find them a computer -> Tag Machine -> Image computer with a base image -> Name Computer(standardiz
  -> Install Software -> Instruct user how to use machine -> If user leaves company, remove user from access
Imaging=Try to automate provisioning a new machine, should take minutes, not hours
Batch Update=Once every month(ish), update all servers with latest security patches, ensure new update works with service
Also need to maintain Printers, Phones, Fax Machines, Video/Conferencing Machines=Can work with vendors to maintain these devices
