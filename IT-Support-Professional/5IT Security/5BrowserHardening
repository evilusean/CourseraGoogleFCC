Browser Hardening
In this reading, you will learn how to harden browsers for enhanced internet security. The methods presented include evaluating sources for 
trustworthiness, SSL certificates, password managers, and browser security best practices. Techniques for browser hardening are important 
components in enterprise-level IT security policies. These techniques can also be used to improve internet security for organizations of any size 
and for individual users. 

Identifying trusted versus untrusted sources
Some cybercriminals monitor SEO search terms for popular software downloads. Then they create fake websites to pose as hosts for these popular
downloads. They might even use advertising and stolen logos of trusted companies to make the sites appear to be legitimate businesses. However,
the downloadable files available on the cybercriminals’ websites are usually malicious software. Unaware of the deception, users download and 
install the malware. In some cases, the users don’t even need to download a file. Savvy cybercriminals can design web pages that have the ability
to infect users’ devices simply upon visiting the sites. 

To guard against threats like this, there are checks you can perform to evaluate websites: 

Use antivirus and anti-malware software and browser extensions. Run antivirus and anti-malware scans regularly and scan downloaded files. Ensure 
antivirus and anti-malware browser extensions are enabled when surfing the web.  

Check for SSL certificates. See the “Secure connections and sites” section below. 

Ensure the URL displayed in the address bar shows the correct domain name. For example, Google websites use the Google.com domain name.

Search for negative reviews of the website from trusted sources. Be wary of websites that have few to no reviews. They may not have been active
long enough to build a bad reputation. Cybercriminals will create new websites when they get too many negative reviews on their older sites. 

Don’t automatically trust website links provided by people or organizations you trust. They may not be aware that they are passing along links to
malicious websites and files. 

Use hashing algorithms for downloaded files. Compare the developer-provided hash value of the original file to the hash value of the downloaded
copy to ensure the two values match.


Secure connections and sites
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates are issued by trusted certificate authorities (CA), such as DigiCert. An SSL certificate indicates that 
any data submitted through a website will be encrypted. A website with a valid SSL certificate has been inspected and verified by the CA. You can 
find SSL certificates by performing the following steps:

Check the URL in the address bar. The URL should begin with the https:// protocol. If you see http:// without the “s”, then the website is not 
secure.

Click on the closed padlock icon in the address bar to the left of the URL. An open lock indicates that the website is not secure. 

A pop-up menu should open. Websites with SSL certificates will have a menu option labeled “Connection is secure.” Click on this menu item.

A new pop-up menu will appear with a link to check the certificate information. The layout and wording of this pop-up will vary depending on
which browser you are using. When you review the certificate, look for the following items:4

The name of the issuer - Make sure it is a trusted certificate authority.

The domain it was issued to - This name should match the website domain name.

The expiration date - The certificate should not have passed its expiration date.

Note that cybercriminals can obtain SSL certificates too. So, this is not a guarantee that the site is safe. CAs also vary in how thorough they
are in their inspections.


Password managers
Password managers are software programs that encrypt and retain passwords in secure cloud storage or locally on users’ personal computing
devices. There are a wide variety of activities users perform online that require unique and complex passwords, such as banking, managing health
records, filing taxes, and more. It can be difficult for users to keep track of so many different logins and passwords. Fortunately, password
managers can help. 

Advantages of using a password manager:
It provides only one password for a user to remember; 
Can generate and store secure passwords that are difficult for cybercriminal tools to crack;
Is more secure than keeping passwords written down on paper or in an unencrypted file on a computer; and
Work across multiple devices and operating systems.

Disadvantages of using a password manager:
It can expose all of the user’s account credentials if a cybercriminal obtains the master password to the password manager;
Can be very difficult for a user to regain access to the password manager account if the master password is lost or forgotten;
Requires the user to learn a new method for logging in to their various accounts in order to retrieve passwords from the password manager 
  software; and
Often requires a fee or subscription for password management services.

A few of the top brands for password manager applications include Bitwarden, Last Pass, and 1Password. Please see the Resource section at the
end of this reading for more information.
