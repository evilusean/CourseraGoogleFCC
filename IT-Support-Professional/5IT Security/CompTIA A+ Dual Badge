Information and FAQs about badges
Congratulations on finishing the last course of the Google IT Support Professional Certificate! What an accomplishment.

Learners who complete all five courses of this certificate are eligible to earn a digital badge from Credly and Google. 

Additionally, Google and CompTIA have teamed up to offer a co-skilled badge of completion. To get the badge, learners must complete the Google IT 
  Support Professional Certificate and pass the CompTIA A+ certification exams (1000 Series). With this dual badge, people who complete the Google
  IT Support Professional Certificate and receive the CompTIA A+ certification are better set up to share their skills with potential employers.

About badges

What is a badge?

A badge is a visual representation of a credential you’ve earned - in this case, your credential is the Google IT Support Professional 
  Certificate! You’ll get a badge upon completion of the program; you can share it on platforms like LinkedIn to catch the attention of potential
  employers.

What is Credly/Acclaim? 

Acclaim is a badging platform that’s part of Credly, a leading digital credential service provider. Acclaim provides badges so that you can
  easily share your achievements to online destinations like LinkedIn, and employers can instantly verify your skills.

About the Google badge

How do I claim my badge for completing the Google IT Support Professional Certificate?

Upon completion of the certificate, you will receive an email letting you know you have earned a badge. From the email, you can choose to claim
  the badge and opt in to share your information for the purposes of badge issuing. If you decide to claim the badge, Coursera will then send a 
  request to Acclaim to issue your badge. If you don’t have an Acclaim account yet, you will be asked to create one before you can accept and 
  view your badge.

Please allow at least one week from your date of completion for the system to update. Make sure to check your spam folder just in case it ends up
  there!

About the Google and CompTIA dual badge

How do I know if I am eligible to get the Google/CompTIA dual badge?

If you complete all five courses of the Google certificate and pass the CompTIA A+ certification exams (1000 series), you’ll have access to a new
  dual badge from CompTIA and Google that you can also post on LinkedIn to catch the attention of potential employers. Learn more here.

What is the difference between the dual badge with CompTIA and the badge for the Professional Certificate?

The dual badge shows that you completed both the Google IT Support Professional Certificate and passed the CompTIA A+ certification exams
  (1000 series). The Professional Certificate badge only shows your completion of the Google IT Support Professional Certificate. If you earn both
  badges, you’re basically a rockstar and we encourage you to share them both on LinkedIn to show off your rockstar status.

I completed the Google IT Support Professional Certificate program and I passed the CompTIA A+ exams but did not receive an email from Acclaim 
  to claim the dual badge. What do I do?

Please submit a request through the Acclaim help center for technical issues: https://support.youracclaim.com/hc/en-us.
