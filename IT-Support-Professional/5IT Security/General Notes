Hashing:
Hash function=A type of function or operation that takes in an arbitrary data input and maps it to an output of fixed size, called a hash/digest
  You feed in any amount of data into a hash function and the resulting output will always be the same size, but the output should be 
  unique to the input such that two inputs will never yield the same output
  Typically used to uniquely identify data; image hashes, 
  Hashing can also be used to identify duplicate data sets in  databases or archives to speed up searching of tables
  or remove duplicate data to save space
Cryptographic Hashing=Distinctly different from encryption because cryptographic hash functions should be one directional
  can be used for; authentication, message integrity, fingerprinting, data corruption detection, digital signatures
The ideal cryptographic hash function should be deterministic, meaning that the same input value should always return the same hash value

  is a function of attacker time and resources
Another way to protect passwords is to run the password through the hashing function multiple times

  DAI will detect forged IP address and drop them, has a table of trusted IP addresses,
  also enforces rate limit of packets per port to prevent ARP scanning
Gratuitous ARP Response=(L2)Man in the middle attack is possible on ARP due to unauthenticated nature of ARP, allows an attacker to forge an ARP 
  response advertising its mac address matching the physical address of a victims IP address, all clients on network would cache this ARP entry
  could then send frames intended for victims IP address to attackers IP address, then IP forwarded to victims PC, monitoring traffic/modify data

  port, you can insert a hub with all devices you want to monitor connected to the hub
Monitor Mode=Allows us to scan accesss channels to see all wireless traffic being sent by APs and clients
TCPDump=A super popular, lightweight, command-line based utility that you can use to capture and analyze packets (LibPCap library)
  Allows you to write packet captures to a file, for later analysis/sharing/replaying traffic/reading back
  default operating mode=provides a brief packet analysis. converts from layers 3 and up to human readable info(source/destination info/ports)
  sudo tcpdump -n -i enol ip and host example.com #-n flag overrides host addresses with commonly used port services
  #-x flag allows you to view raw data that makes up packet as hexadecimal digits

Disk Encryption:
FDE(Full Disk Encryption)=Works by automatically converting data on a hard drive into a form that cannot be understood by anyone who doesn't have
  the key to undo the conversion, to boot needs to be unencrypted, all FDE drives have an unencrypted partition that is able to be attacked
  When you implement a full disk encryption solution at scale, it's important to think about how to handle cases where passwords(key) are forgotten
Secure Boot Protocol=UEFI Spec, uses public key cryptography to boot securely, code signing(Platform Key-Firmware)
Key Escrow=Allows the encryption key to be securely stored for later retrieval by an authorized party(SysAdmins)=another passkey
Home Directory or File-based encryption only guarantees confidentiality and integrity of files protected by encryption
Software Patch Management:
Alot of attacks depend on exploiting bugs in software, can be fixed through patches/updates, install in a timely fashion
Some software has bugs in the core functionality, and can not be mitigated against
Critical Infrastructure devices should be approached carefully when you apply updates. There's always the risk that a software update will
  introduce a new bug that might affect the functionality of the device.
Application Policies:
A common reccomendation/requirement is to only support/require only the latest version of a piece of software
It's Generally a good idea to disallow risky classes of software by policy. Things like file sharing software and piracy related software
  tend to be closely associated with malware infections
Understanding what your users need to do their jobs will help shape your approach to software policies and guidelines
Helping your users accomplish tasks by recommending or supporting specific software makes for a more secure environment
Extensions that require full access to websites visited can be risky, since the extension developer has the power to modify pages visited
