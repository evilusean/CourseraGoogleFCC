  Shoulder surfing= Shoulder surfing happens when a person looks over a victim’s shoulder to watch them enter login credentials
  Impersonation: This attack might happen over email, text messaging, or a phone call. The attacker impersonates someone who should have access to 
    an organization’s computer network. attacker might call the IT Support team to request help with a password reset.
  Dumpster Diving: This in-person attack attacker literally digging through the trash of an individual or organization to hunt for confidential

========================================================================================================Week 2:
Symmetric Encryption:
Encryption=The act of taking a message, called plaintext, and applying an operation to it, called a cipher, so that you receive a garbled,
  unreadable message as the output, ciphertext
Decryption=Taking ciphertext and converting it into plaintext
Encryption Algorithm=The underlying logic of process that's used to convert the plaintext into ciphertext
Key=Introduces something unique into the cipher
Kerchoffs Principle=Security through obscurity, 
  Cryptosystem=A collection of algorithms for key generation/encryption/decryption operations that comprise a cryptographic service should remain
  secure - even if everything about the system is known, except the key
Shannon's Maxim=The enemy knows the system
  The system should remain secure even if your adversary knows exactly what kind of encryption systems you're employing as as your keys remain
  secure
Cryptography=Discipline of coding and hiding messages
Cryptology=Study of Cryptography
Crypt-Analysis=Looking for messages/decryption
Frequency Analysis=The practice of studying the frequency with which letters appear in a ciphertext (letters:e t a o, pairs: th er on an)
Steganography=The practice of hiding information from observers, but not encoding it(embedding messages in files=images/videos)
Symmetric-Key Algorithm=Use same key to encrypt and decrypt messages
Substitution Cipher=An encryption mechanism that replaces parts of your plaintext with ciphertext(caeser cipher: rotate alphabet, rot13)
Stream Cipher=Takes a stream of input and encrupts the stream one character or one digit at a time, outputting one encrypted digit/char at a time
Block Cipher=The cipher takes data in, places it into a bucket or block of data that's a fixed size. then encodes that entire block as one unit
IV(Initialization Vector)=Key Encryption, Random data integrated into encryption key, combined key used to encrypt data
DES(Data Encryption Standard)=Designed in 1970's with IBM/NSA
FIPS(Federal Information Processing Standard)=Govt standards for encrypting and securing govt data(not a private mail server with bleachbit)
NIST(National Institute or Standards And Technology)=64 bit -> 128,192, 256 bit encryption key in 2001 
AES(Advanced Encryption Standard)=128 bit encryption key, modern intel/amd cpus have AES instructions built in
Key Length=Total number of bits(Upper limit) potential strength of encryption, longer key lengths protect against brute force attacks
  Because of the large key size, brute-force attacks on AES are only theoretical right now, because of the computing power required
  (or time required using modern technology) exceeds anything feasible today
An important thing to keep in mind when considering various encryption alogorithms is speed, and ease of implementation
RC4(Rivest Cipher 4)=A symmetric stream cipher that gained widespread adoption because of its simplicity and speed(too easy to break today)
TLS 1.2 with AES GCM=Preferred security configuration in use today

Asymmetric Cryptography(Public key ciphers):
Confidentiality(encrypted), Authenticity(digital signature), Non-repudiation(Author can not dispute origin of message)
Asymmetric=Different Keys used to encrypt and decrypt
Generate a private key to generate a public key, exchange public keys/use to encrypt- only private keys can decrypt 
Public Key Signatures=Compose a message and combine it with private key to generate a digital signature
You can send a symmetric encryption key through Asymmetric encryption securely, then send the rest of the data quicker through symmetric encryption
MACs(Message Authentication Controls)=A bit of information that allows authentication of a received message, ensuring that the message came
  from the alleged sender and not a third party
HMAC=Keyed Hash message authentication code, uses a cryptographic hash function with a secret key to generate a mac
CMAC=Cipher based message authentication code, similar to HMAC, uses a symmetric cipher with a shared key
CBC-MAC=Cipher block chaining message authentication code, takes a message encrypting it using a block cipher, builds a chain of encrypted blocks
RSA=algorithm created in 1983 by Ron Rivetts, Shamir, Adleman-Mechanism using large prime numbers for encryption keys 
DSA(Digital Signature Algorithm)=created in 1991, used for signing and verifying data, uses key-pairs for signing and verifying data
DH(Diffie-Hellman)=Key exchange algorithm, for exchanging keys over an unsecured network, combines shared number with secret number
ECC(Eliptic Curve Cryptography)=A public-key encryption system that uses algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields to generate keys
ECDH=Elipitic Curve Diffie Hellmen Vs ECDSA=Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm =EC Variants
