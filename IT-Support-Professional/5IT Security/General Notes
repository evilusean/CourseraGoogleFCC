========================================================================================================Week 2:

  unreadable message as the output, ciphertext

Encryption Algorithm=The underlying logic of process that's used to convert the plaintext into ciphertext
Key=Introduces something unique into the cipher

Symmetric-Key Algorithm=Use same key to encrypt and decrypt messages
Substitution Cipher=An encryption mechanism that replaces parts of your plaintext with ciphertext(caeser cipher: rotate alphabet, rot13)
Stream Cipher=Takes a stream of input and encrupts the stream one character or one digit at a time, outputting one encrypted digit/char at a time
Block Cipher=The cipher takes data in, places it into a bucket or block of data that's a fixed size. then encodes that entire block as one unit
IV(Initialization Vector)=Key Encryption, Random data integrated into encryption key, combined key used to encrypt data

AES(Advanced Encryption Standard)=128 bit encryption key, modern intel/amd cpus have AES instructions built in
Key Length=Total number of bits(Upper limit) potential strength of encryption, longer key lengths protect against brute force attacks
  Because of the large key size, brute-force attacks on AES are only theoretical right now, because of the computing power required
  (or time required using modern technology) exceeds anything feasible today
An important thing to keep in mind when considering various encryption alogorithms is speed, and ease of implementation
RC4(Rivest Cipher 4)=A symmetric stream cipher that gained widespread adoption because of its simplicity and speed(too easy to break today)
TLS 1.2 with AES GCM=Preferred security configuration in use today

Asymmetric Cryptography(Public key ciphers):
Confidentiality(encrypted), Authenticity(digital signature), Non-repudiation(Author can not dispute origin of message)
Asymmetric=Different Keys used to encrypt and decrypt
Generate a private key to generate a public key, exchange public keys/use to encrypt- only private keys can decrypt 
Public Key Signatures=Compose a message and combine it with private key to generate a digital signature
You can send a symmetric encryption key through Asymmetric encryption securely, then send the rest of the data quicker through symmetric encryption
MACs(Message Authentication Controls)=A bit of information that allows authentication of a received message, ensuring that the message came
  from the alleged sender and not a third party
HMAC=Keyed Hash message authentication code, uses a cryptographic hash function with a secret key to generate a mac
CMAC=Cipher based message authentication code, similar to HMAC, uses a symmetric cipher with a shared key
CBC-MAC=Cipher block chaining message authentication code, takes a message encrypting it using a block cipher, builds a chain of encrypted blocks

ECDH=Elipitic Curve Diffie Hellmen Vs ECDSA=Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm =EC Variants

Hashing:
Hash function=A type of function or operation that takes in an arbitrary data input and maps it to an output of fixed size, called a hash/digest
  You feed in any amount of data into a hash function and the resulting output will always be the same size, but the output should be 
  unique to the input such that two inputs will never yield the same output
  Typically used to uniquely identify data; image hashes, 
  Hashing can also be used to identify duplicate data sets in  databases or archives to speed up searching of tables
  or remove duplicate data to save space
Cryptographic Hashing=Distinctly different from encryption because cryptographic hash functions should be one directional
  can be used for; authentication, message integrity, fingerprinting, data corruption detection, digital signatures
The ideal cryptographic hash function should be deterministic, meaning that the same input value should always return the same hash value
Hash Collisions=Two different inputs mapping to the same output
Hashing Algorithms:
MD5=Designed in 1990's as a cryptographic hashing function, operates on 512 bit blocks- creates 128 bit hash digests
SHA1(Secure Hash Algorithm)=Part of the SHA suite of functions, designed by the NSA, published in 1995-operates 512 bit blocks, 128 bit digest
  used by TSL/SSL, PGP SSH, IPSec, used by Git
MIC(Message Integrity Check)=hash digest of the message in question, like a checksum
You should never store passwords as plaintext, instead create hashes of passwords for authentication, worst case brute force hash digest
It's impossible to defend against a brute force attack entirely, A succesful brute force attack against even the most secure system imaginable,
  is a function of attacker time and resources
Another way to protect passwords is to run the password through the hashing function multiple times
Rainbow Table=A precomputed table of all possible values and corresponding hashes, look up hash in a rainbow table to get password
Password Salt=Additional randomized data that's added into the hashing function to generate a hash that's unique to the password and salt combo

Cryptography Applications:
PKI(Public Key Infrastructure)=Used to securely transmit data and verify identity of a sender of a digital certificate
Digital Certificate=file that proves that an entity owns a public key, public key info -> registered owner + digital signature
CA(Certificate Authority)=Entity responsible for restoring and issuing certificates
RA(Registration Authority)=responsible for verifying identitys requesting a certificate
A central repository is needed to securely store and index keys, and a certificate management system of some sort makes managing access to stored
  certificates and issuance of certificates easier
SSL/TLS server certificate is one of these systems, 
SSL/TLS client certificate=as the name implies, these are certificates bound to clients and are used to authenticate the client to the server,
  allowing access control to an SSL/TLS service
possible for a certificate to be valid for many hostnames, sometimes a wildcard certificate is issued giving validity for all hostnames in domain
Self-signed certificate=signed by same entity that issued certificate
Code signing certificates=Allows users of these signed applications to verify the signatures and ensure that the application was not tampered with
Chain of trust=Starts with root certificate authority root CA=True -> intermediate CA's
End Entity/Leaf certificate=A certificate that has no authority as a CA 
X509 Standard=created in 1988, What defines the format of digital certificates
  Version=Current version 3, What version of the X509 standard the certificate adheres to
  Serial Number=A unique identifir for the certificate assigned by the CA which allows the CA to manage and identify individual certificates
  Certificate Signature Algorithm=This field indicates what public key algorithm is used for the public key and what hashing algorithm is used
    to sign the certificate
  Issuer Name=This field contains information about the authority that signed the certificate
  Validity=This field contains two subfields - "Not Before" and "Not After" which defines the dates when the certificate is valid for
  Subject=This field contains identifying information about the entity the certificate was issued to
  Subject Public Key Info=These two subfields define the algorithm of the public key, along with the public key itself
  Certificate Signature Algorithm=Same as the subject public key info field;These two fields must match
  Certificate Signature Value=The digital signature data itself
Web of trust=Where individuals instead of CA's sign each others public keys, key signing parties
CRL(Certificate Revocation List)=A means to distribute a list of certificates that are no longer valid

HTTPS=The Secure version of HTTP, HyperText Transport Protocol- Also used for VOIP, skype, hangouts, email, instant messaging, wifi
  Encapsulates HTTP traffic over a secure channel using SSL/TLS
TLS grants:
  1)A secure communication line, which means data being transmitted is protected from potential eavesdroppers
  2)The ability to authenticate both parties communicating, though typically only the server is authenticated by the client
  3)The integrity of communications, meaning there are checks to ensure that messages aren't lost or altered in transit
TLS Handshake=Establishes the Secure TLS connection SYN-ACK
Session Key=The shared symmetric encryption key used in TLS sessions to encrypt data being sent back and forth
SSH(Secure Shell)=A secure network protocol that uses encryption to allow access to a network service over unsecured networks
  Most commonly used to remote login to command line based systems,provisions for arbitary network ports/traffic
  Supports different key authentication methods, including customs ones you can write
