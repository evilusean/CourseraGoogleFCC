========================================================================================================================Week 1:
HTML5:
Development Environment:
CDT(Chrome Developer Tools)=Come built in with google chrome browser
Install Node.js -> use npm(Node package manager) to install browser sync -> use browsersync/git to push to github
You can use github to host a webpage that you create, and push updates using git
Can be changed in github settings -> Pages 
You can Clone(Copy) an entire github repository in command line using git with url
command line: git status, git add, git commit, git push #all you need to publish code to github for html purposes
browser-sync start --server --directory --files "*" #browser sync used to locally host server mode of the folder you are currently in "*"=everything
browser sync can be used for a realtime update on any html website you are working on, locally hosted on your machine without webserver
  all you need to do is save and it get's updated, don't need to refresh-saves time, good for development
Asking for help: Stack Overflow, jsfiddle.net, codepen.io
