Project management job categories and common roles 
Introductory-level project management roles
Entry-level project management positions are a great opportunity to get your foot in the door and learn the ins and outs of how a company operates
and manages projects. The lessons you learn from these experiences are extremely valuable to your growth in project management. Some entry-level 
project management positions include:
Agile Project Manager
Scrum Master
IT Project Manager
DevOps Project Manager
Junior Project Manager: Performs all aspects of being a project manager alongside a more experienced professional.
Project Administrator: Assists the rest of the project team with administrative tasks.

  are completed on time and within budget.
Project Support Specialist: Works alongside a project manager and team members to oversee assigned projects. May also be responsible for training
  and developing employees to perform designated tasks.

Traditional project management roles:
Once you have gained some experience in introductory-level positions, you can explore traditional project management roles, such as:
Project Manager: Responsible for the initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, and closing of a project. Includes industry-specific titles like
  IT project manager, construction project manager, or engineering project manager, which utilize skills that are transferable among industries.
Project Analyst: Moves a project along by sharing information, providing support through data analysis, and contributing to strategy and 
  performance. 
Project Leader/Director: Drives core decision-making and sets the direction for the project. Usually knowledgeable about the product or 
  deliverable. 
Project Controller: Primarily responsible for project planning. You are likely to see this job title in industries like engineering and 
  construction.
Technical Project Manager: Conducts project planning and management for identified goals within a company. Ensures that projects are completed
  to the requirements within a defined time frame and budget.
Project Management Office (PMO) Analyst: Manages the progress of complex projects to ensure timely execution and completion.

  long-term goals for their organization.
Portfolio managers: Responsible for managing a group of related programs within the same organization. They coordinate various programs in order 
  to ensure they are on track and that the organization is meeting its strategic initiatives. Portfolio managers look at all projects and
  programs within the organization and prioritize work as necessary. 

Operational management roles :
In operational management roles, you will get the opportunity to experience several different departments and how they interact and operate. 
  Operational management roles allow you to work alongside peers and management from various business segments, giving you an appreciation for 
  what each segment does on a daily basis. Key elements of project management include making sure a project is on budget and on schedule. This 
  course, and your experience as a project manager, will give you the tools to be able to apply those skills to running a business. Some 
  operational management positions include:
Operations Analyst: Manages and coordinates research, investigates workflows, creates business procedures, and recommends changes to improve 
  the project and company. 
Operations Manager: Oversees strategic decision-making and rolls out plans of action based on financial, schedule, and resource reporting. 
Chief Operating Officer: Responsible for overseeing the day-to-day administrative and operational functions of a business.

We will discuss the Agile project management approach in depth later, but here are a couple of the positions you may see that are related to that 
  approach:
Scrum Master: Coordinates and guides the Scrum team. Knowledgeable in Agile framework and Scrum and is able to teach others about the Scrum values
  and principles. May also be listed as a Technical Program Manager or Technical Project Manager.

Job Search Tips:
Understand your target role
One of the primary challenges for anyone looking to launch a new career is how to stand out against candidates who already have experience in the
  field.
Overcoming this challenge begins with developing a comprehensive understanding of the role you’re targeting. You'll need to understand the role in
  the context of any company you’re applying to,
and more broadly as well. Having a holistic understanding of what it takes to succeed in your target role will help you determine your suitability
  for the role, and identify any steps you can take to improve your chances of getting hired.
  
To understand everything from minimum must-have requirements to skills that might help you stand out from the crowd, you can begin by researching
and analyzing job descriptions across different organizations. 

Below you’ll find our recommended strategy for how to approach this process effectively.:
Analyze job listings
The first part of the process is to gather information from multiple job listings:
Pull up ten job descriptions for your target role. To do this, you can use job boards like Indeed, Glassdoor, 
and LinkedIn. Make sure the roles you select come from different companies, share similar titles, and are roles you would actually apply for. 
In each job description, you should be able to identify a section listing requirements for the role. 
Combine all the job requirements. To do this, create a new Google document and copy over all the required responsibilities from all ten job 
  descriptions. 
Order requirements based on appearance frequency. Certain requirements will likely appear in multiple descriptions. The more commonly they appear, 
  the more likely it is that they’re essential for the role. Put the most frequently appearing requirements at the top of your list. For example, 
  a requirement that appears in all ten descriptions would go at the very top.

After completing these steps, you should have a clearer picture of which requirements are most common and important for the role. You may also 
  have questions:
Why do requirements differ across job descriptions? 
One of the most common reasons for this has to do with overly general job titles, or job titles that don’t necessarily communicate the specific
  scope of a given role at a particular company. For example, a program manager at one company might be focused on customer management, 
  while at another company, the emphasis might be on project management. A Data Analyst might primarily use SQL at one company and Python at 
  another. Because of these differences, it’s important to look beyond job titles. This is why we recommend the process outlined above—to help
  ensure you’re targeting the exact roles that are right for you—and that you understand the requirements for those exact roles.

Why are some requirements higher on my list than I thought they would be, while others I expected to see barely show up at all? 
If you’re surprised by your results, you may need to spend more time learning what the role really entails, as you may have some preconceptions 
  about the role that require adjusting. You might also need to do additional research to ensure you’re targeting the right roles in your job 
  search. 

How do I know if I’m really right for my target role?
It’s perfectly normal to experience self-doubt at this stage of the process. Remember, this is a new career for you. You’re not expected to know 
  everything about the role, and it’s likely that your existing skills and experience won’t line up perfectly. The more you learn about the role,
  the better you’ll understand what’s required for success, and the more you’ll know about how to prepare yourself for that success.

Create your professional inventory:
For this next step, you can temporarily set aside the master list of role requirements you previously created. The focus here will be on your 
  existing professional qualifications, and any other skills or experience you possess that might be relevant to your target role and of value to 
  a potential employer. 

To begin, assemble a comprehensive list of the following:
Technical (hard) skills. These are skills relating to a specific task or situation such as programming, technical writing, project management, 
  and more.
Non-technical (interpersonal) skills. These are the skills that enable people to navigate their environment, work well with others, perform well, 
  and achieve their goals. They include skills like communication, leadership, team management, and more.
Personal qualities. These are positive attributes and personality traits such as being honest, having a good sense of humor, and being 
  dependable. You can also include your professional interests on this list.
Education. This includes any post-secondary education, certifications, or independent classes completed online or offline.
Tip: You do not need to limit your professional inventory to skills and qualities developed through professional experience. Consider any
  volunteer, extracurricular, or personal experiences that might help a hiring manager understand your capabilities. 
Once you’ve created your inventory of skills and experience, you’re ready to line these up against your requirements list.

Match your profile to the job requirements:
The concluding step in this process is to match your profile to the job requirements. The goal here is to make it easy for any hiring manager to
  see why you’re a great fit for their role. You’ll accomplish this by learning what to emphasize and focus on in your search, on your resume, and
  during interviews.
To begin, go through your professional inventory of skills and experience, highlighting each item in green, orange, or red, depending on its 
  relevance to your target role. Relevance is determined by whether a given skill appears on your role requirements list, how high it appears on
  your list, and how directly it aligns with your list. 
For example, let’s say you’re interested in a program manager role. If you’re skilled at using project management software, and project management
  software skills are high on your job requirements list, then highlight that item in green. If you have some experience with tools that do not
  consistently show up on job descriptions but could still be relevant, highlight these skills in orange. 
Green should be used for skills that are directly relevant to your target role. You should look for roles that emphasize these skills. You should
  also highlight these skills on your resume, and be prepared to discuss them in an interview.
Orange should be used to identify those skills and experiences that are relevant for the role but not necessarily in a direct way. These are 
  generally your transferable skills—skills that you bring with you from past experiences that can help you succeed in your new role. Plan to have
  to explain these to recruiters and hiring managers, as their relevance may not be immediately evident.
Red should be used for items that are not relevant for your job search. De-prioritize these skills, and steer clear of highlighting them on your 
  resume and focusing on them during interviews.
Of these three categories, the orange items are where you’ll need to focus extra attention. When it comes to transferable skills, you have to do 
  the convincing, as you can’t count on a recruiter or hiring manager making the connection. For example, no job description for a project manager 
  role calls for waitstaff experience. However, that project manager job description will likely mention excellent communication skills—which you
  would have developed during your hospitality career. When applying for the project manager role, make sure your resume specifically mentions
  excellent communication in addition to listing “waiter” or “waitress” as your previous occupation. Once you’ve categorized your skills and 
  experience based on how well they align with the requirements for your target role, you’re ready to move your job search forward.
