The goal of this part is to examine the operations are MTC. Is the inventory managed efficiently.  One specific question you should address is 
whether salespeople carrying inventory is an efficient method of holding inventory.

Currently, a considerable part of the inventory is held as "trunk stock" by the salespeople.  Should this practice continue? As part of the answer,
be sure to provide pro's and con's for this decision.

If we streamline our sales to just in time delivery and allow our salespeople to have designated training kits, that don't need to be sterile, we 
can reduce our overall safety stock
Cons:
-Less Stock available for emergency sales
-reduced service levels and availability
Benefits:
-Reduce overall Stock levels
-Still maintain high levels of service on our training of surgeons

Or we can discontinue the sales merchants(300k-1million per year each) and have designated trainers(amount dependent on demand) to train the 
surgeons who are inexperienced with equipment, we could reduce our required stock levels even further, as well as overhead costs, and increase 
our profits. 
Cons:
-Less Stock available for emergency sales
-reduced service levels and availability
-less quality of service with individual sales representatives
-The good working relationships our sales reps have maintained will be removed
Benefits:
-Reduce overall Stock levels/Overhead cost of many sales representatives
-Still maintain high levels of service on our training of surgeons with trainers
-Availability can be maintained with better coordination and interoperability with hospitals
