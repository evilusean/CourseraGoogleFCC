Current Issues
The major medical device manufacturers, such as Medtronic, have broadened their product portfolio and expanded their international operations. 
In addition, there is a lot of publicity around 3D printing changing the medical devices industry.  In a recent New York Times article, it was
reported that 3D printed limbs can not only provide customized solutions to patients and doctors, but it can provide them at a much lower cost
than traditional prosthetics.  The other major advantage from a supply chain perspective is that inventory management becomes significantly easier
because surgical kits could be printed on-demand and customized to the actual needs of the patient.  Although the technology is still in its 
infancy, it could have a very significant effect on the current competitive landscape.

An important factor in the industry is consolidation.  In addition, the industry went through a number of strategic acquisitions in recent years. 
Most significantly, in June 2014, Medtronic announced plans to acquire Covidien in a deal that will create the largest medical device manufacturer
in the world.  Another facet in the Medtronic-Covidien merger is the fact that it has been called a tax inversion deal.  As the Wall Street Journal 
reported: “The deal, which could be announced Monday, would be structured as a so-called tax inversion, according to one of the people. In such 
deals, acquirers buy companies domiciled in countries with lower corporate tax rates than their own as a means of reducing their overall rate. 
Covidien is based in Ireland, which is known for having a relatively low tax rate: its main corporate tax rate is 12.5%. In the U.S., home to 
Medtronic, the 35% rate is one of the world’s highest.” Other firms could also start considering this option as tax inversion can dramatically 
reduce the expenses of the firm.
