Now, convince me that you are right...
In this module, you will take all of the different aspects you worked on for the entire course so far and create a presentation that could be used to convince the board of directors at MTC your approach is the best way the company can overcome the Medical Devices Excise Tax.

There are several ways you can create this presentation:

You create a visual presentation with an accompanying script (for example in the notes section). To be sure everyone can open it, save them at PDFs.

You can create a visual presentation with an audio narration (I know it is possible in PPT, and possibly some others)

You can create a video presentation by creating a screen capture (there are several software applications that can accomplish this).

In your presentation, please be sure to (at least) include the following:

Introduction of yourself and the case, but please keep this brief since we all know the case.

Executive Summary - what you are proposing to do and the intended outcome.

Areas of improvement - in any order you would like to present.

Resources needed for the improvement.

Risks to your proposal and contingencies to mitigate that risk.

Please do not use more than 20 slides and if you have an audio or video presentation, do not go over 30 minutes.
