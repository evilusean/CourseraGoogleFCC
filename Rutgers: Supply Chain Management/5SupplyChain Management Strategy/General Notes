==========================================================================================Week 1:
Supply Chain Management Strategy=Integration of end to end supply chain functions with purpose in a complex network of companies all over the globe
LOPs=Logistics, Operations, Precision Planning, Holistic Sourcing

==========================================================================================Week 2:
Are Products moving in the most efficient way possible?
Inventory: are we holding the right amount of inventory? Is it in the right location? do we acheive service levels?
  Cycle Stock(Day to day sales) Vs Safety Stock(Just in case, insurance), Demand(increased sales) Vs Logistics(delayed shipments)
  When to order inventory? s.Q(s=reorder point, Q=quantity), s.S(order up to level, difference betweem current inventory and where it should be)
Logistics Network: Build warehouses close to customers, Connect customers to plants/warehouses
Facilities: How many and where? Fewer warehouses=locate inventory in fewer locations/pooled risk/less access to customers/less safety stock
  Transportation device as a storage device
Factors influencing Logistics Networks: Cost Vs Service
Logistics Customer Servce:Keep customers happy, by keeping your promises - no stock outs, meet lead times
fill rate=percentage of orders shipped from inventory

==========================================================================================Week 3:
Operations:
Lean Operations=Management Philosophy that began with Toyota, produce as much product given a set of resources
  Kaizen=Continuous Improvement
  Elimination of wastex7=Transport/inventory/Motion/Waiting/Overproduction/OverProcessing/Defects
Lean Thinking:
  1)Specify Value
  2)Map Value Stream
  3)Make Value Flow
  4)Pull Back from customer(Not push onto customer)
  5)Strive for perfection-eliminate all defects
Warehouses:
  Why do we need them?
  To consolidate raw materials supply -> Creates Efficiences(hold inventory where it's needed), Risk Pooling, Service Levels(Higher)
  Facilitate Movement of product
  Storage - have product available when customers want them
  Information - about inventory, what you have, when it's coming in, how much is going out
  What makes a warehouse good?
  Speed- Best 'A' Sellers shortest distance to shipping dock/warehouse located close to customers
  Quality/Redundancy Checks-ensure it is correct product being shipped
  Productivity-Throughput=How fast you can ship goods

==========================================================================================Week 4:
Naive Forecast=What we sold yesterday, that's what we're going to sell today, what we sell today, that's what we're going to sell tommorrow
  Ft = D(t-1) F=Forcast D=Demand T=Time period
  Use the previous time period to estimate the next time period
  Doesn't Filer out any noise, but is a good benchmark to use against other forecast methods
Cumulative Mean Forecast:
  Take all the data that you have, average it and that is your forecast
  Ft = Sum D / t -1  D=Demand
Forecast Accuracy:
  Bias=Do you have a tendancy to overforecast or underforecast
Mean Error=Sum(D-F) / t(ME) D=demand F=Forecast / Time Period * Mean Error
MAPE(Mean Absolute Percent Error)= SUM(D-F / D) / t
MSE(Mean Squared Error):
  Give more weight to errors
  (D-f)squared / t
Moving Average:
  Takes a subset of data and averages it, changes over time 50/200 day moving average
  A small N(forecast time period) makes it very reactive
  A large N makes it very stable
Exponential Smoothing:
  Uses an Alpha(0-1) to make it more reactive or more stable
  Ft=AlphaDt-1+(1-Alpha)Ft-1
  You need to check with a benchmark to find the best alpha
